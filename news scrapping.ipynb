    "<h1>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This project focuses on web scraping, specifically extracting data from the Setopati news website. The objective is to scrape news data from multiple web pages, with the number of pages determined by the user. The data will then be processed and organized into a final DataFrame for further analysis.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To accomplish this task, the project utilizes several important Python libraries, including Beautiful Soup, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Beautiful Soup is employed for web scraping, allowing the program to extract relevant information from the Setopati web pages. Pandas and NumPy are used for data manipulation and organization, enabling the creation of a structured DataFrame from the raw news data. Matplotlib is utilized for data visualization, enabling the creation of plots and charts to analyze and present the news data.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In addition to these libraries, the project also utilizes NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for news data cleaning. NLTK provides useful functions such as stopwords removal and the PorterStemmer algorithm for stemming words in the news data. Regular expressions are employed to enhance the cleaning process and ensure the data is appropriately formatted.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To further enhance the project's functionality, the final DataFrame can be exported into various formats, such as CSV or Excel, for easier sharing and analysis. This allows users to leverage the extracted news data in other tools and applications.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Overall, the project encompasses the following steps:</b></p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li>Web scraping using Beautiful Soup to extract news data from Setopati web pages.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Data cleaning and preprocessing using NLTK, including stopwords removal and word stemming.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Utilizing regular expressions to enhance the cleaning process and ensure data formatting.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Creating a structured DataFrame from the cleaned news data using Pandas and NumPy.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Applying data visualization techniques with Matplotlib to analyze and present the news data.</li>\n",

    "The code prompts the user to enter the number of pages they want to scrape for each category. It then iterates over the specified number of pages for each category and uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content of each page. It finds the section containing the links and checks if each link meets certain criteria (e.g., having a 6-digit number in the URL). If a link satisfies the criteria, it adds the category and the link to the dataset dictionary. Finally, it prints the dataset containing the scraped data.\n",

There should have been a festive and celebratory mood in the leaders and cadres. But that is not so, he has pointed. There is rage inside and outside the party. Why is that happening?

I will look for answers to such questions, he has revealed. I want to meet people who are not associated with the party structures and try to understand how they are looking at me.

Why is hope disappearing?\\nHe has added that he will talk with people of all age groups and return to Kathmandu only after finding answers to such questions.

       " '\\n                            Mother’s Day is in a couple weeks, but Drake gave his mom an early gift with a heartfelt speech at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, where the rap star also broke Taylor Swift’s record for most wins.\\n\\nDrake turned up the love for his mom when he picked up top artist, besting Cardi B, Ariana Grande, Post Malone and Travis Scott. He won 12 awards Wednesday in Las Vegas, making his career total 27 (Swift has 23 wins).\\n\\nHe looked up to the ceiling as he held the trophy, then said: “I just want to thank my mom for her relentless effort in my life.\\n\\n“I want to thank my mom for all the times you drove me to piano. All the times you drove me to basketball and hockey — that clearly didn’t work out. All the times you drove me to ‘Degrassi.’ No matter how long it took me to figure out what I wanted to do, you were always there to give me a ride, and now we’re on one hell of ride,” Drake said.\\n\\nFamily bonding was a theme at the three-hour show, which aired live on NBC and was hosted by Kelly Clarkson\\n\\nCiara’s young son and husband, NFL player Russell Wilson, danced along while she worked the stage, and Nick and Joe Jonas gave kisses to Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner of “Game of Thrones” fame when they sang in the audience before hitting the stage. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco looked to his parents as he accepted top rock song, quoting the name of his current hit: “Hey look Ma, I made it!”\\n\\nMariah Carey’s twins cheered her on as she sang a medley of her hits and accepted the Icon award. She was in diva form before taking the award from Jennifer Hudson, throwing her napkin on the floor after dabbing her face with it.\\n\\n“Without getting into all the drama, all the ups and downs of my career ... I guess I always felt like an outsider, someone who doesn’t quite belong anywhere, and I still feel like that lost interracial child who had a lot of nerve to believe I could succeed at anything at all in this world. But, and this is the truth, I did believe because I had to,” she said. “The truth is I dedicated my life to my music — my saving grace — and to my fans.”\\n\\nCardi B, the night’s top nominee with 21, locked lips with husband Offset on the red carpet and the couple sat closely inside the venue. She won six awards, including top Hot 100 song for “Girls Like You” with Maroon 5.\\n\\n“I remember when Maroon 5 hit me up to do this song. I was like, ‘Bro I’m five months pregnant. I can’t even breathe.’ But this record to me was so amazing. I was like, ‘Oh this is going to be a hit.’ And now I sing this song to my daughter because she’s the girl that I need,” she said.\\n\\nDrake and Cardi B — who both won multiple awards during the live telecast — used their speeches to promote love and appreciation for their peers in the music industry.\\n\\nOthers, too, brought on the positive energy when onstage. Imagine Dragons’ band leader Dan Reynolds used his speech to highlight the dangers of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. He earned rousing applause. Florida Georgia Line’s Tyler Hubbard followed suit, telling the audience after winning top country song: “In the spirit of so much truth being spoken tonight by so many talented artists, I think we should speak some truth.”\\n\\n“As artists we all get to experience so many unbelievable things, but in our opinion, at the end of the day, it’s all for nothing if you’re not using your platform for better ... to spread love, to help those in needs, to be a light to your community,” he said.\\n\\nSwift kicked off the show when she brought her new music video to life with a colorful, eye-popping performance of her song “ME!” Dancers wearing bright, pastel colors spun in the air holding umbrellas and a marching band kicked off Swift’s performance — like most of the world, maybe she was inspired by Beyonce’s new Coachella film?\\n\\nMadonna, wearing an eye-patch, teamed up with Colombian singer Maluma for a performance, but it was Grammy-winning Christian artist Lauren Daigle who had the night’s best performance. She sang “You Say,” giving the audience a calm, yet strong and powerful performance. She was backed by three awesome background singers and a pianist.\\n\\nBTS, who performed alongside Halsey, also had a major night. At the Billboard Awards and American Music Awards, the K-pop band had only previously won “social” awards based off their fanatic fan base, but on Wednesday BTS picked up top duo/group, besting Grammy-winning groups like Maroon 5, Imagine Dragons and Dan + Shay.\\n\\n“I still can’t believe we’re here on this stage with so many great artists,” RM said as fans screamed loudly. “We’re still the same boys from six years ago, we still have the same dreams ... we still have the same thoughts. Let us keep dreaming.”\\n\\nAn unlikely winner at the Billboard Awards? “Game of Thrones” actress Maisie Williams, whose plays Arya Stark on the HBO series and shined brightly on last week’s episode.\\n\\n“Shout-out to Arya Stark for putting in that work last week,” Drake said onstage after winning his first award of the evening.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

It is long past time for Mr. Depp’s despicable conduct to end.”\\n\\nDepp’s lawsuit, filed last month, called the ongoing allegations of domestic abuse “categorically and demonstrably false.”\\n\\n“They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career,” the lawsuit states, claiming that “she is the perpetrator.”\\n\\nDepp’s attorney, Adam Waldman, said he was reviewing the new filing. He said previously that he and Depp looked forward to providing evidence that would clear Depp’s name.\\n\\nThe Post piece by Heard, published in December, does not mention Depp by name or describe any incidents, but it discusses the societal plight of those who speak up about domestic abuse.\\n\\n“I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath,” the 32-year-old actress wrote, adding that she felt as though she was “on trial in the court of public opinion.”\\n\\nBut Depp’s lawsuit says it was clear Heard was talking about him, and that it worsened the damage the allegations had already done to his career.\\n\\nThe lawsuit states Depp, 55, has suffered financial losses because of the accusations, including being dropped from his role as Capt. Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films.\\n\\nHeard’s lawyers also argued that the lawsuit should be moved to Los Angeles because that’s where the relevant events took place and the court would be in a position to subpoena witnesses and find facts.\\n\\nHeard first accused Depp of domestic violence in May 2016, the year after they were married.

       " '\\n                            Billy Porter, speaking to Vogue before he walked the Oscars red carpet, knew what he was in for among some social media users:\\n\\n“People are going to be really uncomfortable with my black ass in a ball gown, but it’s not anybody’s business but mine.”\\n\\nThe remark from the Tony-winning stage performer, actor and singer was both prescient and disproven. There was mega-praise for his velvet custom tuxedo look by Christian Siriano and outrage over the notion that an African American man in a dress was a threat to black masculinity.\\n\\nIt was just the conversation Porter had hoped to provoke, not to collect virulent hate but to help move along the idea that we all deserve respect, across racial lines and the gender divide.\\n\\n“I was ready to create the conversation,” Porter told The Associated Press in a phone interview Monday the day after the Oscars. “We have to teach people how to treat us, we have to teach people how to love us, we have to teach people how to respect us, and the only way we do that is to respect ourselves.”\\n\\nPorter, the black and gay breakout star of the boundary-expanding FX series “Pose,” spent awards season using fashion as political art, as he describes it. There were previous dresses, and there was help from powerhouses Tom Ford and Michael Kors in the later weeks, along with smaller designers who embrace a greater gender fluidity in their collections and were thrilled early on to dress him.\\n\\nAs a nominee at the Golden Globes, Porter’s custom trouser look by Randi Rahm, including a huge, hot pink-lined cape and floral embellishments, grabbed attention, but social media support and disdain after the 49-year-old took to the Oscars carpet took the debate into the stratosphere.\\n\\nPorter understands where established notions of black masculinity originated, and he understands how toxic they can be. He and his stylist, Sam Ratelle, also realize how rigid gender-driven taboos can be and want to help the walls come down.\\n\\n“It goes all the way back to the earliest of emasculations, which is slavery, so the only way to sort of overcome that is to be the strongest and the most masculine and the most powerful and now, what has become toxic,” Porter said. “And I don’t think it’s just black people. I think it’s men in general. Every ethnicity has their version of it.”\\n\\nPorter couldn’t care less about negative comments.\\n\\n“The comments are not my business. What people think about what I’m doing is not my business. I lived that already,” he said. “I’m inside of my authenticity and the whole point is that you have to respect me as much as I respect you. If you don’t like it, go somewhere else. You don’t have to look. It’s not about you. I don’t understand why my putting on a dress causes this much strife in your life.”\\n\\nRatelle said he began working with Porter about a year ago.\\n\\n“He said, ‘I want to be a piece of walking art,’ and we just went from there,” Ratelle said. “It’s been really awesome to work with a bunch of great designers. Randi Rahm was certainly completely open. Issey Miyake was fantastic for the Radio City show (Porter was a study in white). Christian Siriano, the fact that he did this custom gown in one week, was incredible after saying, ‘Absolutely. There’s no question we’ll do this.’ Michael Kors has been the most gracious human. So has Tom Ford.”\\n\\nPorter said he’s just getting started in terms of pushing along the conversation.\\n\\n“People are actually listening,” he said. “I hope it opens up a dialogue of healing. I will always continue to do me. If there’s anything I’ve learned in the 49 years that I’ve lived on this planet, is that being authentic is the only version of the story that anybody should be.”\\n\\nPorter has always been a fashion lover. This year, he was an ambassador for the Council of Fashion Designers of America for men’s fashion week in New York and attended a variety of shows featuring a variety of looks, from traditional to gender fluid.\\n\\nNow that awards season is over, and the fashion week cycle is finishing up in Paris, Porter said he’ll continue to wear whatever he likes, with a great number of designers on board to help with pulls from their lines and custom outfits.\\n\\n“Pre-Golden Globes it was difficult,” he said of options available to him, considering that he’s not sample size. “After the Golden Globes it has not been difficult. You work with the people who work with you. You walk through the doors that are open. I’m never a beggar.”\\n\\nIn real life, or at least on live TV during the Oscars, Helen Mirren appeared ready for change, noting that both she and her co-presenter, Jason Momoa, were dressed in pink.\\n\\n“It just goes to show, doesn’t it, that these days a Hawaiian god and a very mature Englishwoman can actually wear the same color. We can both wear pink,” she said to claps.\\n\\nMomoa agreed: “Finally. The times are changin’.”\\n',\n",

He told interviewer Robin Roberts he is not a racist and moved past his desire for violence after seeking help from a priest and from friends.\\n\\nNeeson said in an interview published Monday by The Independent that after learning his friend’s attacker was black, he “went up and down areas with a cosh (stick or truncheon)” hoping a black person “would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could kill him.”\\n\\n“It took me a week, maybe a week and a half, to go through that,” Neeson said.\\n\\nNeeson told Roberts he had asked about the race of the attacker, along with other descriptive characteristics. He said Tuesday the topic came up because the interviewer asked him about how he tapped into the feelings of revenge that he displays in “Cold Pursuit,” which tells the story of a father who seeks violent revenge for his son’s death.\\n\\n“We all pretend we’re kind of politically correct,” Neeson, who grew up in Northern Ireland, told Roberts. “I mean, in this country, it’s the same in my own country too, you sometimes just scratch the surface and you discover this racism and bigotry, and it’s there.”\\n',\n",

But at the same time I like to do both things. I don’t like to be limited,” Fonsi said in a recent interview with The Associated Press, in Spanish.\\n\\n“Vida” is his ninth studio album and his first in five years, a time of big changes in his life and his career — especially since 2016, when the birth of his son Rocco overlapped with that of the song that gave him international stardom and a broader exposure to Latin music. The original “Despacito” video, featuring Daddy Yankee, is still the most watched in the history of YouTube with over 5.9 billion views to date; its remix with Justin Bieber remains among the top three songs on Billboard’s list of Hot Latin Songs.\\n\\nBoth versions are included in the album, along with the previously-released singles “Echame la culpa” with Demi Lovato, “Calypso” with Stefflon Don, “Imposible” with Ozuna and “Sola”. It also includes new romantic songs and one powerful torch song that challenged Fonsi’s vocal chords. One of the most personal pieces is “Ahi estas tu,” which he wrote to his son Rocco. (His previous album, “8,” included a tune for his daugher Mikaela.)\\n\\nThere are 15 songs total that cover or fuse Latin pop, RB, dembow, reggaeton and other genres.\\n\\n“I want to be able to dance, make people rejoice, and sometimes sing a ballad with a lot of lyric, a lot of emotion,” said the Puerto Rican singer-songwriter.\\n\\nThe touching RB-infused, piano-led ballad “Dime que no te irás” is also, according to Fonsi, the most difficult to perform vocally.\\n\\nIt “is one of the songs with more weight in this album”, he said. “It’s one of those songs that may not have the commercial value of others, but it does have the musical and emotional value.”\\n\\nHe also highlighted his latest single, “Sola,” a ballad that you may not hear in a club but that will make you nod to its beat.\\n\\n“It’s neither the typical depressing ballad nor a rhythmic pop song and much less a reggaeton, but it’s a hybrid of the new sound of pop and that is something that I’ve always liked to do — to innovate, to suggest new things to my audience and always to follow my own path.”\\n\\nIn regards to the title “Vida,” he said he chose it because the album is kind of an X-ray of his life.\\n\\n“These songs come from very honest, real places. Many have to do with me, many don’t. But I felt that my life is there, in each song,” said Fonsi, remembering himself running between the studio to his house to other professional commitments while his wife was pregnant, Rocco was born and starting to grow. “That life, that excitement, that love that you feel as a father for a child, the most pure and intense form of love — it’s impossible not to reflect that in my music, in the way I communicate. ‘Vida’ is all that. It’s my life.”\\n',\n",

Duterte raised even more controversy when he recently joked that he smoked marijuana to deal with his busy schedule of meetings with other Asian leaders at a regional summit.\\n\\nAsked what she thought about legalizing marijuana, Gray said: “I’m for it being used for medical use, but not so for recreational use. Because I think if people will argue, then what about alcohol and cigarettes?

We have players with good caliber, and they stood up well.\\nSri Lanka had an awful bowling start when left-arm fast bowler Dilshan Madushanka conceded nine runs through a no ball and several wides before the 21-year-olds first legitimate delivery at the sixth attempt.\\nMadushan, who made his T20 debut in the last Super 4 match against Pakistan on Friday, settled his teams nerves quickly by claiming the wickets of Babar Azam (5) and Fakhar Azam (0) off successive deliveries inside the powerplay.\\nBabar was brilliantly snapped up by Madushanka over his head at short fine leg off a hard flick and Fakhar went for a golden duck by dragging the first ball onto his stumps.\\nBabar, the second-ranked T20 batter, ended the tournament with only 68 runs in six games.\\nAs a batting unit we didnt perform according to our potential, Babar said. We didnt finish the way we would have wanted to and gave away 15-20 extra runs  the more you learn from these ups-and-downs is good, but you need to reduce your mistakes.\\nRizwan and Iftikhar Ahmed (32) added 71 runs for the third wicket in almost 10 overs as Sri Lanka kept mounting the pressure by bowling tidily in the middle overs.\\nMadushan broke the stand in his return spell as Pakistan collapsed from 102-3 to lose its last seven wickets for 45 runs with Sri Lanka fielders holding onto all their catches.\\nEarlier, Pakistans fearsome pace attack, led by Haris Rauf (3-29), had Sri Lanka in trouble inside the first nine overs before Rajapaksa and Hasaranga led the recovery.\\nRajapaksa hit six fours and three sixes in his innings.\\nFast bowler Naseem Shah (1-40) had Kusal Mendis clean bowled off the first ball with a stunning inswinging delivery while Rauf dismissed Pathum Nissanka and Danushka Gunathilaka.\\nBut Rajapaksa and Hasaranga counterattacked after having negotiated the spin threat of Shadab Khan (1-28). Surprisingly Babar used his premium left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz for only one over which went for three runs as both Sri Lanka batters cut loose against the pace of Shah and Mohammad Hasnain (0-41).\\nPakistan was scrappy in the field as Rajapaksa was dropped either side of his half century by Shadab in the deep. Rauf had Hasaranga caught behind in the 15th over, but Rajapaksa added a further 54 runs in the last five overs with Chamika Karunaratne, who made 14 not out.\\nRajapaksa provided Sri Lanka with a late flourish when he smashed Shah for a boundary off the penultimate ball and then smashed a six over extra cover to give Sri Lanka a strong total to defend.\\nSri Lanka made a stunning comeback with five successive wins in the tournament after getting beaten by Afghanistan in its opening game.

Then, in a frantic finish, Reece James smashed a shot against the post before Livaković made a stunning double stop to deny Mason Mount then Hakim Ziyech.\\nUltimately, the smash-and-grab win was earned thanks to the early goal by Orić, who met a headed flick-on by Bruno Petković in midfield by chesting the ball forward inside his own half past Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana and racing clear of the newly signed French defender toward goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.\\nAs he approached Kepa, Orić lifted the ball over the keeper and it bobbled into the net.\\nDinamo looked dangerous in the rare attacks it had in a performance underpinned by defensive discipline and, from one counterattack, Stefan Ristovski powered in a rising shot that was tipped onto the crossbar by Kepa, who was selected ahead of Edouard Mendy.\\nIts an underperformance from us, Tuchel said. We have the same story as always  we have an OK start, we dont finish our half-chances, we dont feel it when the game is already there to put to bed in the first 15-20 minutes, then we concede one counter-attack which is far too easy.\\nAnd from there, we struggled.',\n",

Bruno Fernandes found Marcus Rashford in a central position and he slipped in Sancho, who rounded goalkeeper Danny Ward and slotted the ball into an empty net.\\nLeicester is now the Premier Leagues crisis club, with just one point from its first five games and two points adrift in last place. The pressure is rising on its manager, Brendan Rodgers, who grumbled after the match about the clubs failure to strengthen the squad in the summer transfer.\\nLeicester only signed one outfield player, unheralded defender Wout Faes from French club Reims, and he only arrived on deadline day to fill the gap left by the departure of Wesley Fofana to Chelsea.\\nWith the greatest respect, Rodgers said, we have not had the help in the market this team needed.\\nThe hosts only seriously threatened United goalkeeper David De Gea once and that was from a free kick, which James Maddison whipped over the defensive wall and brought out a fine one-handed save.

Ederson had to save at full stretch to keep out Saint-Maximin before substitute Ruben Dias  on for the injured Nathan Ake  deflected Wilsons attempt wide.\\nThe respite proved temporary. Saint-Maximin tricked his way past Kyle Walker and Rodri down the left to cross to the far post where Almiron slid in to turn the ball home. The goal was ruled offside but it was overturned on review.\\nThat Almiron was the scorer was poignant, given he was mocked by City midfielder Jack Grealish in post-title celebrations in May.\\nJoao Cancelo had to come to Edersons rescue after he had rashly raced from his line to confront Almiron and was easily rounded, but the Brazil goalkeeper was picking the ball out of his net once again six minutes before the break. Saint-Maximin cut inside and fed Wilson, who touched the ball back inside past Dias before dispatching it into the net with the outside of his right foot.\\nHaaland was unfortunate not to drag the visitors back level within seven minutes of the restart when his shot was tipped onto the foot of a post by Pope, and his misery was compounded two minutes later when the home side extended their lead.\\nJohn Stones was penalized for bringing down the flying Saint-Maximin 22 meters out and Trippiers free kick gave Ederson little chance.\\nHaaland blasted City back into it from close range from Rodris flick back into the area and should have helped himself to a second three minutes later, but was denied by Popes legs.\\nCity was level, however, seconds later when De Bruyne picked out Silvas run.\\nTrippier was shown a straight red card by referee Jarred Gillett for a cynical trip on De Bruyne, but the official was advised to review the incident and reduced the punishment to a yellow.',\n",

As they jostled at the edge of Palaces penalty area, Nez threw his head back at Andersen and missed. Then, when confronted moments later by the aggrieved defender, Nez turned into Andersen and butted him square in the face.\\nAlready trailing because of Wilfried Zahas 32nd-minute goal, Liverpool was really up against it. But even down to 10 men, Klopps team still dominated possession and Daz earned his team a point by cutting in from the left, slipping between two defenders, and curling a shot into the far corner in front of the Kop.

Firmino missed the game as a precaution, according to Liverpool, so could be fit in a weeks time.\\nEverything went against us during the week, Klopp said.

The result means that Arsenal has won both of its opening league games, with Leicester drawing its first match.\\nJesus was the focus of Arsenals attack throughout the match, with teammates trying to get him the ball at every opportunity. For his first goal, he took one touch after receiving a pass from Xhaka, set himself and then bent a shot that took a slight deflection to sail in past Ward.\\nJesus got a bit of help for his second from Vardy.

He embraced the beautiful game of soccer in his 1958 World Cup debut for Brazil and never really let go.\\nHe won a record three World Cups and was widely regarded as one of his sports greatest players. His majestic and galvanizing presence set him among the most recognizable figures in the world.\\nPel died Thursday at 82. He had undergone treatment for colon cancer since 2021.\\nPel was among the games most prolific scorers and spent nearly two decades enchanting fans and dazzling opponents. His grace, athleticism and moves on soccers highest stage transfixed all. He orchestrated a fast, fluid style of play that revolutionized the sport  a flair that personified Brazilian elegance on the field.\\nHe carried his country to soccers heights and became a global ambassador for his sport in a journey that began on the streets of Sao Paulo state, where he would kick a sock stuffed with newspapers or rags.\\nPel changed everything. He transformed football into art, entertainment, Neymar, a fellow Brazilian soccer player, said on Instagram. Football and Brazil elevated their standing thanks to the King! He is gone, but his magic will endure. Pel is eternal!\\nIn the conversation about soccers greatest player, only the late Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are mentioned alongside him.\\nDifferent sources, counting different sets of games, list Pels goal totals anywhere between 650 (league matches) to 1,281 (all senior matches, some against low-level competition). When Maradona once interviewed Pel, he playfully asked the Brazilian how he accumulated so many goals.\\nThe player who would be dubbed The King was introduced to the world at 17 at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, the youngest player ever at the tournament.\\nPel was the emblem of his countrys World Cup triumph of 1970 in Mexico. He scored in the final and set up Carlos Alberto with a nonchalant pass for the last goal in a 4-1 victory over Italy.\\nThe image of Pel in a bright-yellow Brazil jersey, with the No. 10 stamped on the back, remains alive with soccer fans everywhere. As does his trademark goal celebration  a leap with a right fist thrust high above his head.\\nPels fame was such that in 1967 factions of a civil war in Nigeria agreed to a brief cease-fire so he could play an exhibition match in the country. He was knighted by Britains Queen Elizabeth II in 1997. When Pel visited Washington to help popularize the game in North America, it was the U.S. president who stuck out his hand first.\\nYou dont need to introduce yourself because everyone knows who Pel is, Ronald Reagan said.\\nPel was Brazils first modern Black national hero but rarely spoke about racism in a country where the rich and powerful tend to hail from the white minority.\\nOpposing fans taunted Pel with monkey chants at home and all over the world.\\nHe said that he would never play if he had to stop every time he heard those chants, said Angelica Basthi, one of Pels biographers. He is key for Black peoples pride in Brazil, but never wanted to be a flagbearer.\\nPels life after soccer took many forms. He was a politician  Brazils Extraordinary Minister for Sport  a wealthy businessman, and an ambassador for UNESCO and the United Nations.\\nHe had roles in movies, soap operas and even composed songs and recorded CDs of popular Brazilian music.\\nPel was an ambassador for his sport until his final years but as his health deteriorated his travels and appearances became less frequent. After needing a hip replacement, he started using a cane.\\nHe was often seen in a wheelchair during his final years and did not attend a ceremony to unveil a statue of him representing Brazils 1970 World Cup team.\\nHe gets very shy, he gets very embarrassed, his son Edinho told Globoesporte.com. He doesnt want to go out.\\nPel spent his 80th birthday with a few relatives.\\nPel spent a month hospitalized in 2021 after surgery to remove a tumor from his colon. Pel said he was ready to play 90 minutes, plus extra time, but soon started chemotherapy.\\nBorn Edson Arantes do Nascimento, in the small city of Tres Coracoes in the interior of Minas Gerais state on Oct. 23, 1940, Pel grew up shining shoes to buy his modest soccer gear. His father was also a player.\\nPels talent drew notice when he was 11, and a local professional player brought him to Santos youth squads. Despite his youth and 5-foot-8 frame Pel scored against grown men with the same ease he displayed against friends back home. He debuted with the Brazilian club at 15 in 1956, and the club quickly gained worldwide recognition.\\nThe name Pel came from him mispronouncing the name of a player called Bil. He later became known simply as O Rei  The King.\\nPel went to the 1958 World Cup as a reserve but became a key part for his countrys championship team. His first goal, in which he flicked the ball over the head of a defender and raced around him to volley it home, was voted as one of the best in World Cup history.\\nWhen Pel scored, veteran Swedish midfielder Sigge Parling said, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding.\\nThe 1966 World Cup in England  won by the hosts  was a bitter one for Pel, by then already considered the worlds top player. Brazil was knocked out at the group stage and Pel, angry at fouls and hard tackles by Portugal, swore it was his last World Cup.\\nHe changed his mind and was rejuvenated in the 1970 World Cup. In a game against England, he struck a header for a certain score, but the great goalkeeper Gordon Banks flipped the ball over the bar in an astonishing move. Pel likened the save  one of the best in World Cup history  to a salmon climbing up a waterfall. Later, he scored the opening goal in the final against Italy, his last World Cup match.\\nIn all, Pel played 114 matches with Brazil, scoring a record 95 goals  including 77 in official matches. Most of his goals came with Santos, which he led to five national titles, two Copa Libertadores trophies and two club world championships  all in the 1960s.\\nHis run with Santos stretched over three decades until he went into semi-retirement after the 1972 season. Wealthy European clubs tried to sign him, but the Brazilian government intervened to keep him from being sold, declaring him a national treasure.\\nOn the field, Pels energy, vision and imagination drove a gifted Brazilian national team, with intricate passing combinations slicing defenses while leaving room for players to showcase flashy skills.\\nThe fast, fluid style of play exemplified O Jogo Bonito  Portuguese for The Beautiful Game. And at the center of it all, like a maestro in command of his orchestra, was Pel. It was his 1977 autobiography, My Life and the Beautiful Game, that made the phrase part of soccers lexicon.\\nIn 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pel briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos. Among the dignitaries on hand was perhaps the only other athlete whose renown spanned the globe  Muhammad Ali.\\nPel had two daughters out of wedlock and five children from his first two marriages, to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Assiria Seixas Lemos. He later married businesswoman Marcia Cibele Aoki.',\n",
       " '\\nErling Haaland scored twice on his Premier League debut as Manchester City opened its title defense with a 2-0 win over West Ham on Sunday, showing just why Pep Guardiola spent big to bring in the striker this offseason.\\nHaaland needed 35 minutes to open his City account from the penalty spot after being brought down by the goalkeeper in the area, and then netted with a clinical low finish in the 65th minute to double the lead.\\nAfter Liverpool was held to a draw by Fulham on Saturday, City sent an early warning that it remains the team to beat in England.\\nCity led the league in scoring last season with 99 goals as it edged Liverpool to the title by one point, despite often playing without a recognized striker up front. Having the towering Haaland in the middle only makes Guardiolas attack look even scarier.\\nAfter City struggled to break down West Hams defense in the opening 30 minutes, Haaland showed his speed to accelerate away from two defenders as he ran onto a pass into the box from Ilkay Gundogan and was brought down by substitute goalkeeper Alphonse Areola as they vied for the ball.\\nHe calmly dispatched the penalty by sidefooting into the left corner and then sat down cross-legged in a meditative pose  his trademark goal celebration that could become a frequent sight in the Premier League.\\nAreola, who had to come on in the 29th after Lukasz Fabianski picked up a knock, couldnt do much to prevent the second goal, either.\\nHaaland timed his run perfectly to meet a through ball from Kevin de Bruyne and then used his left foot to slot the ball inside the far corner.\\nHaaland scored 86 goals in 89 games during his three seasons at Borussia Dortmund to establish himself as one of the most-wanted players in Europe before opting to move to City, where his father Alfie played between 2000-03.\\nAlfie Haaland celebrated in the stands as his son became just the second City player to score twice on his Premier League debut, after Sergio Aguero did so in 2011.\\nHe was taken off in the 78th to a standing ovation, having missed out on a hat trick when his header sailed high.\\nJudging by this performance, though, it wont be long before the next goal comes along for Haaland.',\n",
       " '\\nNew manager, same old problems for Manchester United.\\nUnited slumped to a 2-1 loss against Brighton at Old Trafford on Sunday in Erik ten Hags first Premier League game in charge, dispelling any notion that the Dutch coach could provide an instant fix to the many issues that plagued the team last season.\\nUnited looked vulnerable in defense  with Pascal Gross scoring twice in the first half to put Brighton in control  and toothless in attack until Cristiano Ronaldo came on early in the second half.\\nAnd the questions about Ronaldos future at the club remain.\\nTen Hag decided to leave Ronaldo out of his starting lineup after the Portugal star only played 45 minutes in preseason amid reports he wants to leave for a Champions League club.\\nBut its clear why Ten Hag wants to keep the 37-year-old forward as United looked much more dangerous with him on the field, although the hosts needed a goalkeeping error to pull a goal back.\\nRobert Sanchez failed to punch away a corner and then got in the way of Alexis Mac Allister, who tried to clear the ball only to send it into his own net in the 68th.\\nUnited continued to push forward but never came close to an equalizer as Brighton held on for a first win at Old Trafford in the clubs history.\\nIt was obviously disappointing and the worst possible start at halftime to be 2-0 down at Old Trafford, United defender Harry Maguire said. Not good enough. We huffed and puffed and we got one back and we had chances to equalize, but its a bad start for us.\\nWhile United improved in the second half, the first 45 minutes showed just how big a task Ten Hag is facing to turn around a club that finished sixth in the Premier League last season.\\nWhile the hosts dominated possession, the only good chance they created came in the sixth minute when a cross was deflected into the path of Bruno Fernandes, who sent his shot well high of the bar.\\nBrighton took the lead in the 30th when Danny Welbeck made a run into the area to collect a pass from Leandro Trossard near the byline and then squared the ball across goal for Gross to tap into an empty net.\\nThe second goal came after a quick counterattack, with Gross on hand to tap in the rebound after Solly March cut inside and saw his shot parried by David de Gea.\\nI thought we had an idea of how to attack and when we could we tried to press and put them under pressure, Brighton manager Graham Potter said. We were positive, brave and the boys gave everything. Our performance in the first half was really strong.\\nRonaldo instantly gave United a jolt when he came on in the 52nd and set up Marcus Rashford for a one-on-one against Sanchez in the 60th but the goalkeeper blocked the forwards shot. The offside flag was up against Ronaldo, but replays hinted he had stayed onside.\\nThat was the closest Ronaldo came to making an impact, though, as the Ten Hag era got off to a losing start.\\nUniteds players were booed off at halftime and at the final whistle, with Ten Hag looking grim-faced as he walked off the field.',\n",

In the seventh minute, he pounced on a low cross from Achraf Hakimi to have a first-time effort deflected out by Alidu Seidu.\\nTwo minutes later, Pablo Sarabia squared the ball back for Messi, who flicked it toward Neymar. The Brazil forward controlled the ball before burying it into the bottom corner.\\nPSG capitalized on a fast break in the 26th when Neymar found Achraf Hakimi, who fired into the top corner.\\nNeymar set up the third goal with a pinpoint free kick for Marquinhos, who headed home in the 39th.\\nOn the stroke of halftime, Neymar fed Messi, whose shot was saved by goalkeeper Mory Diaw.\\nPSG slowed down a bit in the second half against a Clermont side which narrowly avoided relegation last season.\\nMessi still made it 4-0 in the 80th. He played a one-two with Neymar before netting with a low strike.\\nThe Argentina superstar sealed the win in the 86th by chesting down a ball over the top from Leandro Paredes to score with an overhead kick.\\nWhat I have liked is the teams desire to win the ball back very quickly, to play with a lot of intensity, PSG coach Christophe Galtier said. Leo reacts reacts very quickly when possession is lost, and Ney has also made efforts in his defensive positioning to help the team stay very compact and win the ball.\\nChasing a record 11th league title, PSG missed Kylian Mbappe, who is nursing a groin problem, and Renato Sanches, who was signed on Thursday and lacked match fitness.\\nPSG left out of its matchday squad some high-profile players it reportedly wants to move out: Mauro Icardi, Julian Draxler, Ander Herrera, Idrissa Gueye, Rafinha, Thilo Kehrer and Layvin Kurzawa.\\nMeanwhile, Krepin Diatta and Sofiane Diop scored for a weakened Monaco to prevail at Strasbourg 2-1.\\nIn a clash between contenders for European spots, Diatta opened the scoring with a powerful volley from the edge of the box in the 43rd. The Senegal winger could have added another goal in the 48th but Strasbourg goalkeeper Matz Sels saved his chip.\\nDiop, a France Under-21 international, doubled the lead by converting a rebound in the 53rd after Sels palmed away a deflected cross from Gelson Martins.\\nStrasbourg forward Habib Diallo pulled one back in the 65th by heading in a cross from Thomas Delaine.\\nMonaco and Strasbourg finished third and sixth, respectively, last season.\\nSels limited the damage by denying Martins in the 35th, diverting onto the post a close-range effort from Jean Lucas in the 61st, and saving a downward header from substitute Maghnes Akliouche in the 85th.\\nMonaco goalkeeper Alexander Nubel preserved the win in injury time by stopping a point-blank shot from Adrien Thomasson.\\nWe had chances to lead 3-0 and 4-0, Monaco coach Philippe Clement said. Its a matter of experience. Its normal with young players, they must learn lessons, they must gain experience in such situations.\\nMonaco missed the suspended Kevin Volland and Aleksandr Golovin, the injured Takumi Minamino, Benoit Badiashile and Myron Boadu, and an ill Caio Henrique.',\n",

But Nunez came off the bench to score one goal and set up the other for Mohamed Salah.\\nLiverpool nearly grabbed all three points when Jordan Henderson hit the crossbar in injury time with a long-distance shot, but even Klopp agreed that a win would have been undeserved.\\nThe start of the game was really bad from us, Klopp said. No direction, no positivity, no opening up, no breaking lines, nothing (of) what you have to do.\\nIt was a different story in north London, where Tottenham reacted superbly to going behind in the 12th minute.\\nRyan Sessegnon and Eric Dier put Spurs in front by halftime and Southampton defender Mohammed Salibu netted a comical own goal when trying to clear the ball off the line in the 61st minute. Dejan Kulusevski capped a stellar performance by slotting in the fourth two minutes later.\\nIt was a perfect start for us, despite going behind, Conte said. I liked the game a lot for the result but especially the way in which the result was created  creating many chances to score, good possession, good high and medium pressure and we were good when we lost the ball and the intensity to try and get it back. ... Today we have seen (the) summer work with my players.\\nConte spent much of last season complaining about a lack of squad depth, but still opted not to start any of the teams six offseason signings. Ivan Perisic, Clement Lenglet and Yves Bissouma came off the bench instead to show that Conte also has increased options this season as Spurs tries to join champion Manchester City and Liverpool in the fight for the title.\\nNEWCASTLE SPOILS FORESTS RETURN\\nNottingham Forest spent most of the game defending in its return to the top flight after an absence of 23 years. The newcomer held firm for nearly an hour at St. James Park but couldnt prevent Newcastles Fabian Schar from finally breaking the deadlock with a long-range shot. Newcastle won 2-0 after Callum Wilson added the second in the 78th.\\nWe were second best in the game no doubt, Forest manager Steve Cooper said.

I know him well and the thing I know about him is he is only going to get better.\\nCHELSEA HAVE THINGS TO IMPROVE\\nChelsea earned its first win at Goodison Park in five visits, but coach Thomas Tuchel acknowledged his team looked rusty as he tries to incorporate new signings while coping with the lack of a pure striker.\\nWe have things to improve but this isnt a surprise, Tuchel said. We struggled physically but showed the spirit to get the clean sheet.\\nEverton is also without a striker and lost two more players as Ben Godfrey was carried off early with a suspected broken leg and Yerry Mina exited in the second half with an ankle injury.\\nGodfreys injury meant there was eight minutes of stoppage time in the first half, and Jorginho converted a penalty seconds before the interval after Abdoulaye Doucoure pulled down Ben Chilwell.',\n",

       " '\\nPresident Ram Chandra Paudel authenticated the Citizenship Bill that was passed by the previous parliament.\\nThis has created a strange situationhe has authenticated the bill sent by the parliament whose one part (the then House of Representatives) no longer exists.\\nA new HoR is in existence after the federal election in November 2022. President Paudel has authenticated the bill that was not passed by the new HoR. This should not have happened. \\nWe have arrived at this situation due to the mistake committed by then president Bidya Devi Bhandari. Current President Paudel has committed another mistake while correcting that mistake on the request of the Cabinet. He has authenticated the bill arguing that he is constitutionally and morally mandated to comply with the Cabinets request.\\nThe government that requested for committing this mistake, therefore, must take responsibility for this. The government had the option of taking a new bill to the current HoR and passing it with majority. But the government chose an easy and illegal path on the pretext that the main opposition CPN-UML would protest and even obstruct House proceedings thereby obstructing passage of the bill.\\nLegality of the amended Citizenship Act would be tested if anyone moved the Supreme Court (SC) against the authentication. The apex court can rule on the issues including whether the president is mandated to authenticate a bill passed by the House and whether the president can authenticate a bill that the previous president refused to authenticate. The SC can also speak about whether a bill automatically becomes law if the president refuses to authenticate it as mandated by the Constitution.\\nThe sad part of this is that the country will now have to suffer unnecessary hassle for some time. The country will now be stuck in the dispute as to whether President Paudel was right to authenticate the bill.\\nThose who had protested against then president Bhandaris refusal to authenticate the bill, have moral rights to oppose the step of President Paudel. But those who had argued that Bhandari was right to twice refuse to authenticate the bill passed by the parliament dont have the rights to protest against the step of Paudel.\\nWhat Bhandari did in capacity of president was not just unconstitutional but even unimaginable. Can she refuse to administer oath of office and secrecy pointing she doesnt like the prime minister elected by the House or not? Can she refuse to administer oath of office and secrecy pointing she doesnt like the person picked as chief justice (CJ) or chief of any other constitutional body and endorsed by the House after parliamentary hearing or not? Can she refuse to implement any decision made by the Cabinet pointing she doesnt like the decision?\\nThe answer is straightforwardshe cannot.\\nBut she did so and refused to authenticate the bill that was twice sent to her after being passed by the House. She insisted that she was above the parliament.\\nThe House should either have impeached her or moved the court seeking legal remedy at that time. Her move should have been resisted from the streets if both of those options were not possible because the president does not have the rights to defy the Constitution. But the parties did not choose to politically resist her unconstitutional step or seek legal remedy as the HoR was already dissolved and the country was facing elections. She got away with the crime.\\nThe Constitution of Nepal does not grant any rightto the president to take initiative and work. Our Constitution, in that sense, considers the post of president to be absolutely ceremonial. Let us see what the Constitution has to say about the president. Article 61 says four things about the president.\\n(1) There shall be a President of Nepal.\\n(2) The President shall be the Head of State of Nepal. He or she shall perform his or her functions in accordance with this Constitution and federal law.\\n(3) The President shall promote national unity of Nepal.\\n(4) The main duty of the President shall be to abide by and protect the Constitution.\\nThe Interim Constitution 2007, which was in effect before the current one was promulgated, had mentioned that the main duty of the President shall be to protect and abide by the Constitution.\\nThe order of protect and abide by was changed in the current Constitution promulgated in 2015, and abide was written first followed by protect.\\nThe spirit of the current Constitution is clearthe president can protect the Constitution only by abiding by it. The president cannot refuse to abide by the Constitution on the pretext of protecting it. The president not abiding by the Constitution is dereliction of duty. \\nLet us be clear, anybody inciting the president to cross the limits of Constitution is inciting for dereliction of duty.\\nArticle 66 further clarifies about the functions, duties and powers of president:\\n(1) The President shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as conferred on him or her in accordance with this Constitution or the federal law.\\n(2) In exercising the powers or duties under clause (1), the President shall perform all other functions to be performed by him or her on recommendation and with the consent of the Council of Ministers than those functions specifically providedto be performed on recommendation of any institution or official under this Constitution or federal law. Such recommendation and consent shall be submitted through the Prime Minister.\\nIn this way, the president is clearly bound by the Constitution. The president performs functions on the recommendation of the Cabinet or on the recommendation of some other body or official clearly designated by the Constitution. The Constitution has not given the president the right to take a decision or execute any work regarding the country and government affairs on her own. The Constitution has also not given the president the right to take away the rights granted to others. Therefore, our president is a ceremonial president bound by the Constitution.\\nDespite such clear provisions regarding the presidents rights and duties, Bidya Devi Bhandari had assaulted the Constitution by not authenticating the bill. And the main opposition party UML had incited her for the assault. Several UML leaders including the chairman had defended the assault. Therefore they now dont have the moral right to oppose President Paudels move.\\nOthers can, however, oppose the presidents move and challenge it in court. The courts interpretation will provide an outlet to this dispute too, and will set a precedent for the future. It is precedents like this that will continue to further refine and establish the Constitution.\\nFor now, though, theres a pleasant side to the presidents move: nearly 700,000 people have been deprived of citizenship even though they are children of Nepalis who became citizens by birth through a one-time arrangement after the Janaandolan II in 2006; they will now get citizenship immediately. They will get justice. Their lives will move ahead exercising their rights as Nepali citizens.',\n",

       " \"\\nPrime Minister (PM) Pushpa Kamal Dahal on March 20 decided to provide Rs 200,000 each to the then disqualified Maoist combatants when his party CPN (Maoist Center) was almost alone in the Cabinet and he was overseeing 16 ministries.\\nWe wrote an editorial two days later explaining why the decision was wrong. We were clear then and even today that those who Dahal is trying to pay with the hard-earned money of taxpayers were not combatants.\\nThe Maoists and other ruling parties have not been able to prove that those who are going to be paid are former combatants. They have not been able to show that the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) or any other past agreement had said that they should be paid. Nobody from the ruling parties has been able to come forward to defend this decision to dole out money.\\nWe still challenge Maoist Center and the government--Ifthey are men who had fought during the armed conflict and the peace accord or any other past agreement had said that they should be paid, show evidence. Or else stop this plunder of the taxpayers' money, and high-handednes.\\nAccountability for doling out taxpayers money to the Maoist cadres now will not only be sought from Maoist Center but even Nepali Congress (NC) that is the largest party in the ruling coalition and heads the Finance Ministry.\\nThere are reports that the government has prepared a working procedure for providing Rs 200,000 each to the then disqualified Maoist combatants and the Finance Ministry has allocated budget for the purpose.\\nNC Chief Whip Ramesh Lekhak after the meeting of ruling coalition on March 22 had publicly stated that PM Dahal claimed in the meeting that decision to pay former Maoist combatants had not been taken. \\nWhy is the government now trying to legally dole out money by preparing a working procedure if PM Dahal had said so? NC and other coalition partners must seek answer for that from PM Dahal. If Dahal had not said so, a responsible NC leader can be deemed to have publicly lied to mislead the people. \\nWhether PM Dahal had said so or not can be determined later. But those who were not even combatants should not be paid with taxpayers money on any pretext. This should be stopped. If the government does not stop it, somebody should move the court to stop it.\\nLets look at the Maoist claims that they are former combatants.\\nThey claim that these 4,000 persons are combatants who had participated in the Maoist armed conflict. They should also have received financial relief as per the spirit of the peace deal. But they were not provided relief by labeling them disqualified on different pretexts and suffered injustice. They were neither allowed to be integrated with the Nepal Army nor were paid by the state. It is, therefore, necessary to pay them even 15 years after signing of the peace deal as per the spirit of the deal. \\nIt is necessary to understand the peace process and the process of integrating Maoist combatants to know why these 4,000 persons who the Maoists want to pay with the taxpayers money are not former combatants and there was no agreement to pay them in this manner.\\nThe seven political parties and the Maoists on November 8, 2006, had agreed to keep Maoist combatants in the main cantonments at Kailali, Surkhet, Rolpa, Palpa, Kavre, Sindhuli and Ilam districts, and that the combatants would be verified and monitored by the UN to hold peaceful and fair Constituent Assembly Election without any fear, and democratization and restructuring of the Nepal Army as per the spirit of the 12-point agreement, 8-point agreement, 25-point code of conduct, and the five-point letter sent to the UN on August 9, 2006.\\nThe peace agreement signed on November 21, 2006 after that had agreed to keep the Maoist combatants and their weapons in the cantonments.\\nThe agreement for monitoring of management of the weapons and combatants on December 6, 2006 then set standards for Maoist combatants. A person must have joined the Maoists before May 25, 2006, and be born before May 25, 1988 to qualify as a combatant during the verification process.\\nThe cut-off date of birth was kept to be prior to May 25, 1988 to ensure that they would have completed at least 18 years on the cut-off date for joining the Maoist army. An agreement, in other words, was reached that a minor younger than 18 years would not be recognized as a combatant. Using child soldiers in war is a crime even under international laws which deem those leading such wars to have committed a crime.\\nThe Maoists sent a total of 32,350 persons to seven main cantonments and 21 sub-cantonments spread across the country saying they were combatants after the agreement for monitoring of management of the weapons and combatants on December 6, 2006.\\nThe United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) then started the verification process to determine who out of them were combatants, and who were not. Most of them were not combatants and had left the cantonments even before verification. \\nA total of 8,640 of those in the cantonments did not even turn up for the second stage of interview for verification of combatants.\\nUNMIN finally verified 19,602 of them to be combatants. Only 17,076 of them were present in the first stage of reclassification.\\nA total of 15,630 Maoist combatants then opted for voluntary retirement and returned home with Rs 500,000-800,000 while 1,422 were integrated in the Nepal Army. The 4,008 persons who UNMIN verified were not combatants left the cantonments without any payment. Because no agreement said that they would be paid after being found that they were not combatants.\\nHow had they reached the cantonments then?\\nThe number of combatants who had fought in the Maoist armed conflict was actually very low. A video of Maoist supremo Dahal talking about the numbers during a speech in the Shaktikhor cantonment had become public back then. Dahal had conceded in Shaktikhor that the Maoists actually had only around 7,000 combatants and taken pride in having been able to keep 30,000-35,000 persons in the cantonments fooling the state. \\nThe 4,008 expelled by UNMIN included their thousands of cadres and their children who were sent to the cantonments by the Maoists saying they would get relief package from the state.\\nMany of those 4,008 expelled by UNMIN saying they were not combatants had not completed 18 years until May 25, 2006. A total of 1,973 were below 18 years while 1,035 others could not prove that they had joined the Maoist army before the cut-off date of May 25, 2006 for joining the Maoist army even though they had completed 18.\\nUNMIN did not even investigate whether the 1,973 minors had joined the Maoist army or not. It first investigated age, and said that those who were underage were not eligible to become combatants without checking when they had been recruited.\\nIt was difficult to go there even for UNMIN because verifying that child soldiers were recruited by the Maoists would have meant that the Maoist leadership had committed the crime of using child soldiers. That would have attracted international laws. UNMIN, therefore, did not venture there, and the Maoist leadership was freed from the accusation of using child soldiers for then.\\nIf the Maoist leadership now insists that they were indeed combatants and participated in the armed conflict and hence should be compensated, that would establish that the Maoists had used child soldiers in the conflict. Is the Maoist leadership ready to face the consequences of accepting to have used child soldiers in the conflict?\\nUNMIN had not strictly investigated even the adult combatants then. Those who could answer a few simple questions were verified to be combatants. Over 19,000 were, therefore, verified to be combatants even though Dahal had conceded in the Shaktikhor video that the Maoists actually had only around 7,000 combatants. The state spent around Rs 20 billion in their management and integration. There was embezzlement of billions in the name of running the Maoist cantonments. The advance of Rs 460 million taken by Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara for the combatants at cantonments was never reimbursed.\\nEveryone turned a blind eye to that to establish peace in the country and bring the Maoists into the mainstream. How necessary that was would perhaps be evaluated by history.\\nBut the way the Maoists have continued their efforts to dole out taxpayers money to their cadres even after joining mainstream politics and 16 years after the peace deal is condemnable.\\nThis is not the first time that attempts have ben made to give those 4,000 persons Rs 200,000 each. The Maoists had first made the attempt in 2012 when its leader Baburam Bhattarai was PM. It was made again when there was a coalition government including CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) in 2016.\\nFinance Minister Bishnu Paudel in the then KP Sharma Oli government had allocated Rs 840 million to pay Rs 200,000 each to the disqualified combatants and to those who had opted for voluntary retirement but had not received the lump sum in the budget for the fiscal year 2073/74.\\nThat distribution was stopped when a few NC cadres and conflict victims moved the Supreme Court (SC) against the decision.\\nDahal has now become PM for the third time. It has already been 15 years since he first became PM. It may not have been unnatural for him to have more rebellious attitude and less responsibility toward the state. But the determination showed by Dahal to try to pay his cadres from the state coffers when he has become PM for the third time is irresponsible. It shows that he has failed to understand the sensitivity of current times and his responsibility toward the general public.\\nThe country is currently in a difficult economic situation. Not only Nepal, the whole world is affected by recession. In South Asia, all countries except India are going through a difficult economic situation. Those countries, including Nepal, have taken assistance from the International Monetary Fund to sustain the economy.\\nThe recession has also affected the market and the general public. Many businesses have not been able to pay salaries on time. Many have furloughed their staff. The businesses themselves are in a tight spot as they are not able to pay the banks interest. Then theres the mental stress of those with fixed income who have to pay installments to banks. The government has not been able to collect revenues due to the recession. If the situation worsens further, a situation could arise where it would be difficult to provide salaries to employees and to service debts.\\nHow can the act of PM, who should be leading the job of extricating the country from this economic challenge, doling out nearly a billion rupees from the state coffers to his cadres in the name of combatants be justified at such a time? The patience of general public toward the government is already wearing thin.\\nWe, therefore, politely advise those in the government to never do something that they cannot publicly defend and justify. The dissatisfaction of people 2can explode any time if you try to further test their patience, and that will not spare anyone.\",\n",
       " \"\\nThe establishment of public enterprises dates back to the early 19th century during the Industrial Revolution. During that time, in some countries private companies had monopolized critical industries, leading to high prices, and goods and services of poor quality. Whereas in some developing countries like Nepal, there was a lack of infrastructure, not many industries, and less investment capacity of the private sector. So, like the rest of the world, Nepal too wholeheartedly welcomed public enterprises with the establishment of Biratnagar Jute Mill in 1950.\\nOver the past decade, public enterprises (PE) all over the world have faced numerous economic, financial, and political crises. Some of the main reasons being government interference, mismanagement, and corruption. Political interference can lead to decisions that prioritize political goals over economic efficiency and effectiveness, which can cause financial losses and operational inefficiencies. Public enterprises around the world such as Air India, Petrobras, a state-owned oil company in Brazil, Indian Railways, British Leyland, etc started facing numerous financial crises, leading to multiple bailouts by the respective governments. A similar path was followed by public enterprises in Nepal where public enterprises were a burden on taxpayers.\\nThe fall of state-led planning and the adoption of market-based systems which started in the mid-20th century was driven by economic stagnation, high inflation, and mounting debt. The shift towardmarket-based approaches was particularly pronounced in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, where the collapse of communism led to privatization and market-oriented reforms. The belief that market-based approaches are more efficient, flexible, and responsive to changing economic conditions than state-led planning drove this change. Nepal too was a part of the wave and the restoration of multi-party system in Nepal in 1990 marked a significant turning point in the country's political and economic history as the new democratic government in Nepal recognized this problem. Privatization and liberalization became key strategies for eradicating these problems. The government then enacted the Privatization Act 1994 which provides answers to all the arguments dwelling around privatization. Major reasons to enact the Privatization Act 1994 were, the falling productivity of the enterprises, the inability of the government to bear any additional financial burden, and the promotion of the private sector to boost the economy. The government, however, has displayed a reluctance to fully embrace the important tenets of the reforms that were deemed crucial at the time, which can be perceived as a double standard approach. Notably, there have been instances of the government introducing private-public partnership arrangements, which have failed to fully privatize public companies.\\nDespite the degrading performance of public companies starting from 1994Nepal has been according high priority to public enterprises ever since the Second Plan of the National Planning Commission (NPC). They are consideredthe Vehicle for Development. There are 44 total public enterprises in Nepal among which 22 are profit-making, 19 are loss-making and three are closed. More importantly, according to the fiscal year 2020/2021, even for profit-making public enterprises, their profits are going down significantly by 40.3%, of those loss-making public enterprises, their losses continue to rise by 3.6% and administrative expenses tend to go up in all of them. Regardless, in the fiscal year, 2022/2023 government spent a total of Rs. 96.7 billion budget on public enterprisesincluding Rs. 62.3 billion as foreign assistance. On top of that, the government gave an additional subsidy of Rs. 8.1 billion in the same year. They were envisaged as an instrument for production and the execution of socioeconomic policies in the country. The budget speech for the fiscal year 2022/2023 states The Janakpur Cigarette Factory, Agricultural Tools Factory, Gorakhkali Rubber Industry, Orient and Magnesite, Nepal Metal Company, Biratnagar Jute Mill, Birgunj Sugar Mill, Hetauda Textile Industry and Butwal Spinning Mills, will be brought into operation in a systematic way. The promises made by government ministers regarding the revival of public enterprises are often unfounded and lack a solid strategy for achieving long-term success. We will further discuss why running public enterprises are ineffective in Nepal and should be privatized immediately.\\nStakeholders as Risk Averters\\nTo successfully run a business, the management must possess a significant risk-taking capacity. However, this is a quality that public sector entities often lack due to their prioritization of procedures over outcomes. In these sectors, stakeholders are primarily concerned with safeguarding their reputations, as any deviation from established protocols can result in scrutiny from anti-graftbodies such as the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). This can be illustrated by the preference for private sector banks over government-run banks when seeking loans, as private banks offer greater flexibility in considering factors such as start-up ideas or company stocks, whereas government banks are limited to collateral as the sole determinant of loan eligibility. In light of the potential consequences for stakeholders who take risks beyond established protocols, it is understandable that they tend to incline on the side of caution.\\nNon-Value Adding Protocols\\nSimilarly, having to follow protocols that do not add any value also stretches the decision-making process in the public sector as it often results in a huge opportunity cost. One example would be the comparison between Maruti Cement and Udaipur Cement. Both companies are situated in the same location with the same proximity to resources and the neighboring country India. Even the ores of both the companies are same in Sindhali, but despite that in the fiscal year 2020/2021 Maruti Cement incurred a profit of Rs5.631 billionwhereas Udaipur Cement incurred a loss of Rs 3.3 bn. This is because when these companies need to buy machinery for their operation Maruti Cement can instantly purchase from its supplier at the best price and deal, whereas for Udaipur Cement its procedure requires it to open a long tender process costing the company millions of opportunity cost. Although the bidding process is usually fair, tenders often do not fall below a certain amount set by the government, leaving the company with less bargaining power. Apart from this where Maruti Cement has to transport its raw materials in trucks which is a relatively expensive medium for transportation,Udaipur Cement is leveraged with its own 13.8-kmcable ropeway to transport limestone from Sindhali-hill to the factory cutting its cost significantly. Despite this advantage, Udaipur Cement's loss indicates its inability to compete effectively, highlighting the need for the company to be privatized.\\nLack of Accountability\\nLikewise, the issue of lack of accountability within public enterprises in Nepal is a well-documented problem that has contributed to their poor performance and financial losses as the government bails out the public enterprises regardless of the outcome leaving the stakeholders with no incentive to maximize the profit. Four months after the Royal Nepal Airlines made the biggest purchase in Nepali aviation history, acquiring two Airbus A330-200s for Rs. 2.75 billion the corporation said that it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and asked for a bailout of Rs 20 billion, declaring itself crisis-ridden which was provided by the government as subsidy. Additionally, the stakeholders of the public enterprises are designated on the basis of monthly payroll. Hence regardless of the loss made by their company they are entitled to their share of the salary and are entitled to an appraisal every five years regardless of their performance again leaving them with no incentive to maximize the profit.\\nPolitical Interference\\nFurthermore, political interference is another factor contributing to the inefficiency of public enterprises in Nepal. The government often appoints unqualified or under-qualified individuals to top positions in public enterprises based on political connections rather than merit, resulting in poor decision-making, lack of accountability, and a culture of corruption within public enterprises. One example is the case of Nepal Oil Corporation(NOC) where in 2018, a parliamentary committee found that the NOC had incurred a loss of Rs1.7 billion due to irregularities in the procurement of petroleum products. The committee's report stated that political interference was the primary cause of the irregularities, as senior officials in the NOC were appointed based on political connections. The report also stated that the NOC had paid Rs 650 million to a private company without conducting a proper tender process, which was again attributed to political interference. It was also revealed that the NOC had paid up to Rs 1.3 million per kattha of land on the banks of the Rohani River in Bhairahawa while the actual value of the land was less than Rs 500,000.\\nThen Why this Affinity TowardPublic Enterprise?\\nDespite this, people often fail to understand that the loss incurred by public enterprises is a loss incurred by the general public. Additionally, there is often socialist propaganda against privatization, especially in developing countries, perpetuated by interest groups and politicians who argue that private companies are solely motivated by profit, which only benefits the rich and evades taxes. However, these accusations are often baseless as private companies do contribute to the country's economy through taxes. While it is true that some private companies evade taxes, it is unfair to blame privatization as a concept rather than the individuals responsible for that. Moreover, the issue of tax evasion often involves collusion between government employees and the private sector. This problem can be addressed if the government body is strong and accountable. This propaganda can also be explained by an economic term called The Public Choice Theory which suggests that politicians are self-interested and motivated by their own goals, including gaining votes and maintaining their power. In the case of public companies in Nepal, politicians often prioritize them and splurge huge budgets on them, even though they may incur significant losses. This can be attributed to the fact that public companies provide opportunities for politicians to gain support and votes from a major voting pool, which includes employees of these companies, their families, and their communities. By investing in public companies, politicians can gain the loyalty and support of these groups, which can translate into votes during elections. Furthermore, politicians often use public companies as a means of redistributing wealth and resources, particularly to their constituencies, thereby consolidating their power and influence. However, this focus on public companies often leads to inefficient resource allocation, as resources are directed towardcompanies that may not be financially viable, rather than towardmore productive uses. This can result in significant losses for these companies and ultimately affect the overall economic performance of the country.\\nUndeniably, there may be situations where private companies are not financially viable or efficient. Ultimately, the question of who is most capable of successfully running business operations within a country must be considered, and it is clear that in case of Nepal, the government is not the most adept entity for this task. Over the years, public enterprises have faced challenges such as inefficiency, corruption, and mismanagement, leading to financial losses and a decline in service quality. The government's reluctance to fully embrace privatization and liberalization has made the situation worse, as public enterprises are now unsustainable and a burden on taxpayers. The poor performance of public enterprises each year indicates the need for immediate privatization. On the brighter side, the government on April 22 formed a Public Institutions Suggestion Committee after billions of investments made in public enterprises failed to yield any returns. The committee needs to consider all the above aspects and fully embrace privatization to contain any more avoidable burden to the economy which is already in a critical state.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nKathmandu Mayor Balen Shah has issued instruction to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar and the Shital Niwas from Saturday. Waste materials are starting to pile up at the countrys administrative center and other sensitive areas of the state after his instruction to Paribartan Nepal, a private company that has been collecting garbage. \\nGarbage of Singha Durbar will not be picked from today. Leaders there will have to be dumped at Sisdole if the country really has to be cleaned, Shah had posted on Facebook Saturday to inform about stopping garbage collection.\\nBoth the expression and the deed of Shah are irresponsible and anarchic.\\nThose in public position should not just fulfill their responsibilities but also maintain decorum of their post. They should also think about dignity of others. What does he actually mean by leaders from Singha Durbar will have to be dumped at Sisdole if the country really has to be cleaned? This is absolutely anarchic and apolitical expression in itself. This says more about Shah himself than other leaders.\\nLeaders, whether seated at the Singha Durbar or the Bag Durbar, have both strengths and weaknesses. People have elected them to their respective posts expecting them to resolve the countrys problems remaining within their limits and maintaining dignity.\\nShah seems to suffer from this mental illness that only he is right and all the others deserve to be dumped at Sisdole. He can criticize the works of others and also recommend to work in a certain manner. He can offer support but cannot run away from his responsibilities by abusing and blaming others.\\nHe posted a defense of his decision to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar on Monday listing the works in which 14 ministries of the federal government did not cooperate with him. The majorityof the issues he has raised are beyond his jurisdiction. He has stake in them in capacity of a citizen and a mayor, and can also speak about them or provide suggestion. But he cannot stop picking of garbage from the Prime Ministers Office and the Presidents Office citing lack of cooperation by others in issues not in his jurisdiction. \\nKathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) not picking garbage from the Prime Ministers Office and the Presidents Office is as unimaginable and irresponsible as the federal government stopping budget allocated for the KMC or not sending staffers citing lack of supportfrom mayor.\\nLet us look at some of the issues he says that the federal government has not cooperated on. He has said that he met different ministers once or twice and talked about issues ranging from the program of bringing Melamchi water round the year to Kathmandu by connecting Yangri and Larke rivers to Melamchi to management of Melamchi water and pipeline, appropriate management of the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL), procurement of fertilizers for the farmers, cooperative regulations and laws, expansion of the Ring Road, sanitation of public hospitals, insurance, implementation of the Supreme Court (SC) order to demolish the top story of the Health Ministry, and even passing the map of airport.\\nHe has stated that he reached the conclusion to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar as the problems have not been resolved and there was no appropriate coordination despite his efforts for nine months.\\nSome of the issues and works he has raised may be of concern for him but definitely not in his jurisdiction. Those problems will not be resolved merely after him meeting the ministers and talking with them. The line ministries and government bodies work in their own manner and there may be dalliance and lack of appropriate coordination in some of those works. There may even be corruption in some of those works. But that all comes downto the capacity of our overall state system. That is precisely why we are in the current state.\\nIf a mere meeting of the mayor with the ministers were to resolve those problems, they would not have remained unresolved until now in the first place. There is an error in the thinking that problems remain only because nobody wants them resolved. To think all seated at the Singha Durbar are crooks and say that they deserve to be dumped at Sisdole is his hubris and madness.\\nWhy many problems that the KMC can resolve on its own remain as they were if the problems facing the country could be resolved magically as he seems to think or if mere good intentions were to suffice? Has the KMC completed all the works that it can do on its own?\\nThe KMC has not been able to resolve many problems that many other metropolitan cities have resolved.\\nLet us look at a small example. There is problem of squatters in almost all the metropolitan cities of the country. There are genuine and fake squatters in all metropolitan cities. It is necessary to first ascertain who out of them are genuine squatters and who are not to resolve the problem. Record must be collected by going to the squatter settlements for that. It is the responsibility of the metropolitan cities to do that. The state has formulated a policy to address those identified as genuine squatters in that manner. The state accepts that it has responsibility toward them. It is basic responsibility of the state even from the perspective of social justice. Many metropolitan cities have moved forward toward resolving the problem after collecting record of squatters but the KMC is not ready to collect record of squatters. It contends that all of them are encroachers and their record, therefore, should not be collected. Shah stresses on removing them even at the cost of a bloody clash deploying excavators and the police. He has made many attempts to that regard. The KMC has been forced to take a step back after clash with the squatters on eachoccasion.\\nHis main gripe with the Singha Durbar is lack of mobilization of police to exercise force on the squatters. A civilized state that believes in social justice never can, and should, support him in this wrong objective. \\nMayor Balen Shah suffers from this attitude that all he thinks and believes in is right, and all others think and believe in iswrong, and only he is right and all others are wrong. His prescription of dumping all others at Sisdole to develop the country is manifestation of that attitude.\\nKMC is not just Balen Shah. It also has other elected representatives. He seems to have unilaterally taken the decision to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar and the Shital Niwas without consulting anyone. Deputy mayor and the ward chair concerned have confirmed that the mayors decision was made without informing them. The other elected peoples representatives of KMC also cannot evade this issue now. They must speak clearly whether what he has done is right or wrong. They must form a position as to whether to do so in the pretext of cooperation from the federal government is right or not.\\nLet us assume that the Prime Ministers Office and the ministries actually did not cooperate. Why drag the office of the constitutional president in this? How is the office of the head of state connected to this? Why was the prestige of that office not considered even a bit?\\nLet the other elected representatives of KMC and the federal government speak clearly to Mayor Shah. Let the federal government immediately provide support and coordination it can in the works of KMC. Not just the KMC but even other local bodies and provincial government have been facing obstruction in their works in lack of necessary laws and downward delegation of the rights.Let the federal government work for resolving that as soon as possible.\\nLet everyone remind Mayor Balen Shah of his limits, the dignity and responsibilities of mayoralty; tell him that federal, provincial and local governments must move forward with mutual support, coordination and cooperation; and remind him that problems cannot be resolved by blaming and abusing one another.',\n",

Many businesses have not been able to pay salaries on time. Many have furloughed their staff. The businesses themselves are in a tight spot as they are not able to pay the banks interest. Then theres the mental stress of those with fixed income who have to pay installments to banks. The government has not been able to collect revenues due to the recession. If the situation worsens further, a situation could arise where it would be difficult to provide salaries to employees and to service debts.\\nWhat message will it send to the general public when the PM wants to dole out nearly a billion rupees from the state coffers to his cadres in the name of combatants at a time when he should be leading the job of extricating the country from this economic challenge?\\nWhat do coalition partner NC and NC leaders who are ironing their daura-suruwals to join the government say about it? On what basis will NC, which was against it when it was in the opposition in the past, support it now? Maybe it will now be opposed by UML, which had tried to provide Rs 200,000 each to these 4,000 people to appease the Maoists by including it in the budget itself. Trust in parties has deteriorated almost to a point of no return because of this double standard.\\nLets call a spade a spade, whether in the government or in the opposition.\\nThe Maoists wont be able to justify in any way the rationale behind their plan to distribute the tax money collected from the publics hard work to their cadres. There has been no agreement in the past to provide money from the state coffers to those who were not combatants. The Maoists should put a stop to such attempts at recklessly imposing a burden on the state coffers and splurging on its cadres in the name of peace agreement.',\n",
       " \"\\nParliamentary system, they say, gives two governments to the voters at one go: one is the government that takes over the reins of power and the other the government-in-waiting.\\nThe government that takes over power performs in accordance with the commitments made to the people. The parliamentary system expects that the government works for the people and their benefits.\\nBut the parties that assume powers do not necessarily always abide by these democratic ideals. They often don't do so going by our own experience. The government has its own interests and compulsions, and the leaders of the parties also have their own agendas and interests. They often put their own agendas above the interests of the people and the country. The government prevails over the people and their fundamental rights at such times, and tries to curtail the people's rights to serve its own interests.\\nThe voters in parliamentary democracy, therefore, also elect the main opposition party or the government-in-waiting to stop such despotic whims of the government. Parliamentary system is such a system of balance that puts the strongest party or coalition in power, and the next strongest party in the opposition so that the despotic whims of the government are challenged; it can strongly stand in the House for the people's rights and their daily lives, and compliance of the Constitution and laws to stop those in power from abusing the Constitution and the laws. \\nThe ruling party also fears the opposition party, aware that it is the government-in-waiting. The ruling party is always alert about the possibility of the people bringing it down from power and putting the main opposition party in power in the next election.\\nNepali Congress (NC), which calls itself the defender of parliamentary democracy, has demolished this beautiful balance of power inherent in the parliamentary system.\\nNC President and Parliamentary Party Leader Sher Bahadur Deuba has shirked the immense role and responsibilities of the main opposition party to participate in the unholy wagering for power. Setopati reminds him that the politicians that run away from the august role of the main opposition leader also do not have any moral grounds to take over the reins of power tomorrow.\\nHaving contested the election forging an electoral alliance with the promise of forming the government from the same coalition, Deuba failed to give the government promised to the people. His greed for power was mainly to blame for the unraveling of that coalition after he broke his promise to make CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal prime minister (PM) first and tried to become PM instead, thereby forcing Dahal to take refuge at Balkot. Deuba has again started to wager for power after a new ruling coalition was formed comprising CPN-UML, Maoist Center and five other parties.\\nDeuba and those close to him seem to have hoped for Maoist support during the presidential election for now, and aspired for eventually breaking the current coalition in the long run. The way in which NC leader Ram Chandra Paudel has openly defended the decision to give vote of confidence to Dahal hints as much. The way Paudel has been abandoning his ideals for personal interests in recent times is appalling.\\nDahal also seems to want to have the cake and eat it too by acquiring support from the two parties larger than his. He reached Deuba's new residence at Dhumbarahi after going to KP Sharma Oli's at Balkot as per that strategy.\\nIt is not hard to see through Dahal's strategy of keeping his post safe scaring Oli by showing Deuba and vice versa. The course of this strategy, however, will end after the presidential election. He must choose one out of NC and UML in the presidential election. \\nNC has deviated from the spirit of the parliamentary system of either forming the government or playing a strong role of opposition respecting the people's mandate at a time when the system has come under vehement attack, and the limits and dignity of democracy have been increasingly crossed by everyone.\\nOur Constitution has not authorized the PM to dissolve the House as long as the final alternative to give the government remains. But Oli twice dissolved the House crossing the limits of the Constitution that he himself prepared with wanton abandon, and the Supreme Court rightly reinstated the House deeming the dissolution unconstitutional on both the occasions.\\nBut Oli shamelessly tried to defend his unconstitutional step of dissolving the House from the rostrum of the very sovereign House on Monday and Tuesday.\\nOn the other hand, President Bidya Devi Bhandari has repeatedly put herself above the Constitution and Parliament. The Constitution has not given her the right to obstruct any work of the Cabinet or defy its decisions. But Bhandari has been sitting on two ordinances passed by the Cabinet. By refusing to authenticate a bill passed by Parliament, she has behaved in a manner to suggest she is above the sovereign Parliament elected by the people.\\nOli, who himself flouted the Constitution, and his party have publicly defended the presidents actions. UML has lost the moral right to protest if a president elected with the support of another party were to disobey the decisions of a government under its leadership tomorrow.\\nThe moral turpitude seen in parties who are major proponents of this system and Constitution during such attacks on the Constitution and the system has become a matter of great concern.\\nParliamentary system becomes strong only when its major stakeholders agree to stay within its boundaries regardless of whether they are in power or out of power, and when they remain devoted to protecting the essence of the system. Those who are the first to violate the Constitution and break the system at the slightest opportunity are the biggest threat to parliamentary system and this Constitution. Unfortunately, Congress has also joined their ranks today.\\nNepali Congress is constantly becoming weaker, both morally and in terms of public support, during the period with the ever power-hungry Deuba as its president.\\nIn the 2017 general election Nepali Congress became the second-largest party in terms of popular votes for the first time in Nepals political history. President Deuba defended himself saying UML finished ahead of them on popular votes because of the left alliance even though the popular votes of Nepali Congress had increased.\\nThere was no left alliance in this years election. UML had split. CPN (Unified Socialist), which had splintered from UML, received nearly 300,000 votes. But UML still became the largest party in terms of popular votes, finishing ahead of Congress by more than 150,000 votes.\\nNC has been losing the grounds to form a government on its own in recent times due to gradual erosion of its political base. The grand old party looks doomed to losing even the status of main opposition party looking at the people's revulsion toward the NC leadership and its recent misdeeds.\\nThe lawmakers in the party who have yet to lose conscience must, therefore, seriously review the role of NC. They should play the role of a strong opposition in the House relinquishing the rat race for power in the current difficult situation for the parliamentary system if they have even an iota of historical responsibilities of the party. Play that role for safeguarding the people's rights and their interests, at least conserve a party to pin the people's hopes on if they lose trust in the parties in power to ensure that they don't give up on the parliamentary system.\",\n",
       " \"\\nThe people have already elected 165 House of Representatives (HoR) members directly while the process of electing another 110 members through the Proportional Representation (PR) electoral system is in the final stage. A total of 275 elected lawmakers will enter the HoR in a few weeks to formulate laws for the country through periodic election.\\nThe main tenet of democracy is the people legislating for themselves exercising that sovereign right through their representatives.\\nThe elected people's representatives form the government to work for the people and formulate laws to bind that government and the general public. Nobody is above those laws and there is rule of law in the country. The biggest importance and spirit of modern democracy is vested in that.\\nThe gerontocratic leaders of old parties with longevity like that of the sun and the moon who cannot see anything but power and do not care about any norms and limits of democracy have been repeatedly attacking this spirit. This has happened once again.\\nBut the issue is graver than those of yesterday because a new government is going to be formed after the previous mandate expired. New lawmakers have been elected as people's representatives. The government formed as per the previous mandate and already past expiry date has amended an important criminal law through an ordinance with utter disregard for them. The law of the land does not allow the government to withdraw cases of grave crimes sub judice in the court. The court has repeatedly cautioned the government through its orders and verdicts in that regard.\\nThe place to discuss and debate about the matter if someone in special circumstances is hard done by the prevailing laws and court precedents, and to amend them is the House elected by the people. The ordinance brought by the government now, therefore, is not right in the crucible of time, people's mandate, Constitution, laws or political morality. The government should, therefore, take back this ordinance.\\nThere are many dimensions to the issue of 'bringing this ordinance for justice to' Resham Chaudhary, who has been jailed for almost five years, and other political rebels.\\nFirst things first, this ordinance has not been brought to ensure justice for Chaudhary. The government could have taken the bill related to the issue to the previous HoR if it genuinely felt that Chaudhary suffered injustice. This government has been in power for around one and a half years and had a clear majority in the previous House. The current ordinance has come as a bargaining tool for power. It has been brought to solicit Chaudhary's support in mustering a majority for the ruling coalition in the newly elected House. This quid pro quo will further complicate the issue of 'injustice' to Chaudhary, and will condemn him to further injustice.\\nChaudhary is facing a court case as one of the main accused of the Tikapur incident in which eight police personnel including an SSP of Nepal Police and a toddler were lynched on August 24, 2015. He has been claiming that he was outside Tikapur on that day and he did not have anything to do with the attack on the police.\\nThe then government had formed a judicial commission under former Supreme Court (SC) justice Girish Chandra Lal to find facts about the incident after thorough investigation. And that commission submitted its report almost five years back. The government has changed many times in the intervening period but the government has yet to make that report public.\\nChaudhary's supporters claim that the report does not implicate Chaudhary in the Tikapur incident as the court case filed by the government contends, and many feel that he has been unjustly implicated and jailed. The government has supported these claims by not making the report public.\\nA large chunk of the Tharu community genuinely feels that Chaudhary is suffering injustice due to the shady character of the major political parties that say one thing when they are in power and quite another while in the opposition. This grievance of the Tharu community has manifested in this election. Nagarik Unmukti Party, registered under the leadership of Chaudhary's wife Ranjeeta Shrestha, has won three HoR seats under the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system while the party's Lalbir Chaudhary has been elected as an independent candidate from Bardiya-2 after filing rebel candidacy. The party has won 12 seats in the provincial assembly and has secured almost 300,000 votes in the PR electoral system for HoR. This shows the sympathy of the Tharu community toward Resham Chaudhary and the degree of their displeasure toward the case filed against him.\\nThe newly elected House cannot ignore the issue. It is the responsibility of the new House to study the Lal report, explore the additional aspects of the Tikapur incident, and prepare legal grounds and way toward justice for him if it concludes that he indeed has suffered injustice.\\nThe new House can grant justice to Chaudhary in the true sense only by amending the law completing due procedures if he has suffered injustice, and acquit him of the allegations slapped against him. He will be deemed offender by a large chunk of the people if he is released through the ordinance as part of the quid pro quo for the government. That will be a bigger injustice to him. We, therefore, also urge him to not stress on the horse trading for government.\\nAs far as the leaders of the ruling parties are concerned, they have been found repeatedly wanting on the issue of democratic processes and rule of law. Every leader of big parties has made a mockery of rule of law and abused the laws for vested interests while in the government. Ordinance, which is brought at the time of emergency or absence of House for essential works that must be done, has been turned into a tool of rulers for their vested interests.\\nThere are rising aspirations of the people, especially the younger generation, that there is exercise of advanced democracy, rule of law, and democracy does not turn into an armor to cover up the caprices of those in power. The new generation has delivered that very message by establishing new parties in the recent HoR election.\\nThe archaic leaders of the old parties have been repeatedly proving how alienated they are from these aspirations by bringing such ordinances. They will perhaps continue that until they are displaced.\",\n",
       " '\\nThe Election Commission has asked Setopati through an email to remove a news report published on Friday within 24 hours. We had published a news titled Agni Kharels son Nishan in US Army, also continues to hold Nepali citizenship on Friday. The Election Commission on Saturday has asked for removal of the news report within 24 hours and sought explanation stating There was character assassination of an individual who is candidate in the election and his family, and the news report has been published in a way that there is personal allegation.\\nThe letter issued by the Election Commission has yet to arrive in Setopati. We will decide whether to directly move the court to seek legal remedy or furnish explanation to the Election Commission once we receive the letter. We firmly believe that the Election Commission has instructed for removal of the news violating the limits and decorum of a constitutional commission on an issue it is not concerned with.\\nWe have four major disagreements over the instruction by the Election Commission to remove the news and explanation it has sought.\\nFirst, the Election Commission has sought explanation on one hand while it has instructed to remove the news without waiting for that explanation on the other. This behavior of the Election Commission is ill-intentioned and unfortunate in itself.\\nThe second is about its allegation that there was character assassination of an individual who is candidate in the election and his family, and the news report has been published in a way that there is personal allegation.\\nThe news report published in Setopati mentions that Agni Kharels son Nishan Kharel serves in the US Army, and he still holds Nepali citizenship certificate and is included in the voter list. Both of those are facts. The Election Commission itself can check with its voter list. Our news report mentions that Agni Kharel himself has told Seopati that his son Nishan has been serving in the US Army for seven years.\\nWe want to ask the Election Commissionhow does this news report slander Agni Kharel who is candidate in the election, and his family? How is it an allegation?\\nThe Election Commission instead has publicly slandered us by making such false allegations against Setopati. We challenge the Election Commission to prove this allegation, and request it to withdraw the same if it cant.\\nWe are clear that Nishan Kharel or any other Nepali reserves the rights to serve in the US or British or Indian army, or army or other security force of other countries, and it is a matter of individual choice for the person concerned.\\nSetopati stands for personal freedom of any individual. We dont believe that moral questions can ever be asked of anyone on the basis of whether the person stays in Nepal or abroad, or serves in the Nepal Army or army of another country. People take decisions on the basis of their convenience and wish in different situations, and act accordingly. It is their individual and sovereign right if the decisions they take or their action do not harm others and do not violate the laws. We always respect those rights, and will always strive to protect those rights.\\nWe also believe that the fact that a family member of a big leader or those who hold a major public position serves in a foreign army is a matter of interest for commoners, and hence a subject of news. We have, therefore, published the news of Nishan Kharel.\\nThose serving in the US Army should at least have permission for permanent residency in America. The person can easily acquire US citizenship after serving in the US Army. Nishan, who has been serving for seven years, should relinquish Nepali citizenship if he has acquired US citizenship. Not doing so would be against the laws of Nepal. We had asked Nishans father Agni whether Nishan has acquired US citizenship or not as he still holds Nepali citizenship. He could not say about Nishans US citizenship with certainty. We have also included Agnis response in the news report. It is unfortunate that a constitutional body like the Election Commission has made allegations against a news story that we have reported complying with the decorum of journalism and completing due processes.\\nThird, this news is not related to the upcoming elections. It, therefore, does not attract the election code of conduct, nor can the Election Commission instruct for removal of the news citing the code of conduct. The Election Commission is not the authorized body to seek explanation about the news published by any media house or instruct for its removal.\\nFourth, this is not the first time the Election Commission has sought clarification from Setopati in the name of election code of conduct. During the last local elections held in May, too, the Election Commission had sought clarification from us and instructed us to remove an election-related news. We had sent our clarification to the Election Commission refusing to remove the news.\\nThat time the Election Commission had accused Setopati of violating the code of conduct by publishing election analyses based on conversations with voters of different local bodies. We were clear then and we are clear today as well that a voter has the right to privacy regarding who they want to vote for in an election. They need not reveal why they would or would not vote for somebody.\\nAlso, voters also have the right to freedom of expression to publicly state why they would or would not vote for a candidate. Not only that, citizens also have the right to be politically organized, solicit votes for a political party and organize rallies.\\nSimilarly, if any citizen tells a journalist without hesitation why she would or would not vote for somebody, what politician she likes or doesnt like, whom she wants to help get elected or defeated, then a media house has the right to publish it. The Constitution itself has guaranteed that right and also defined its limits.\\nIf it deems it necessary to ban the press from writing on something not prohibited by the Constitution and justifies that, then the legislature should formulate a law for it. The Election Commission cannot prepare a code of conduct that prohibits writing on issues not prohibited by the Constitution and the laws. The Election Commissions code of conduct is not a law. We have already stated this in our earlier written clarification to the Election Commission.\\nTherefore, we urge the Election Commission to not discourage the press time and again, in the name of code of conduct, from reporting citizens views on political parties and leaders. We would also like to remind the Election Commission that such an act goes against the constitutional rights of citizens and the press.',\n",
       " '\\nOn October 22 and 23, the Nepal Army (NA) organized a crucially important program to reflect on Nepals contribution to UN peace operations (PO). One of the several activities of the celebration was a seminar titled Emerging capability requirements for UN Peace Operations and way forward on October 23 at the NA headquarters where UN Under Secretary General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix virtually addressed the gathering. Chief Secretary of the Government of Nepal, NA Chief, and Military Advisor of the Secretary General of the UN and Nepal delegation head General Birame Diop were the other key persons to address the august gathering.\\nThere were four presentations (3 from UN and 1 from NA) where I was also invited to make comments on presentations of two UN officialsDeveloping and deploying capability needs for protection mandates by Oliver Ulich (Deputy Representative UNHQ) and Recommendations for TCCs like Nepal for generating and deploying suitable capabilities in UN Peace Operations by Major General Hugh Van Roosen (retired).\\nThe NA deserves special appreciation for organizing this very timely and highly relevant seminar and reflecting on our contribution to global peace, security and stability. It is equally important to critically look at what Nepal gained from this engagement and whether it is equitable compared to its contribution. Are we able to exhaust the potential for positioning Nepal as a champion of peacekeeping at the global level? What do we have to do to maximize our leverage and potential in this context and what should the UN think regarding the existing provisions of Troop and Police Contributing Countries (TPCC) in general and Nepal in particular?\\nBeing a Nepali, I am very proud of the great contribution of our peacekeepers to maintaining international peace and security, one of the very foundational reasons of establishment of the UN in 1945, immediately after the Second World War by 51 countries.\\nThat a Nepali peacekeepr accompanied the then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for the UN in 2001 is evidence of the importance of Nepali peacekeepers in the UN and the contribution of Nepal to the UN peace mission.\\nNepal has gained unique experiences by engaging in achieving stability and peace in highly unstable countries like Lebanon, Iraq, Mali, South Sudan, DRC, Yemen, Libya, the Central African Republic, Syria, Israel, Western Sahara, South Sudan and many others, thereby providing us with a powerful negotiation tool with the UN for expanded engagement in the future.\\nAccording to a recently (on the seminar) unveiled coffee-table book about Nepals contribution to the UN by the NA, more than 140,000 Nepali troops have engaged in 43 UN peacekeeping missions around the world so far. At present, about 5,623 Nepali men and women are serving in 12 peacekeeping missions in different parts of the world.\\nFurther, Nepal is one of the only two TPCCs that have formed military units in all protection of civilian (POC) missions. This also shows the commitment of Nepal toward the global peace and stability mission of the UN.\\nSo far, Peace Operation (PO) of the UN is largely guided by narrow, top-down headquarters, and the burden loaded on TPCCs (for example, capability needs for protection mandates to be arranged on their own), which needs to be changed to become more relevant. Nepal being the second largest contributor to UN peacekeeping, this is a direct concern. Capabilities for protection should not limit to training, units and equipment, and personnel which UN is advocating but also include commitment of international support. Only then can it be termed Whole-of-Mission Approach and it should always cover all four protection mandates (protection of civilians, child protection, conflict-related sexual violence, and human rights).\\nEven though the three tiers of POC conceptsdialogue and engagement; physical protection; and establishment of protective environmentare pragmatic, it is essential to add security governance and civil military relations in the third component establishment of protective environment, to enhance trust, ownership and gain local support.\\nOne of the weak concepts used in the UN military component about responsibilities at the strategic level is Do No Harm, which is a contextual operational concept developed by Mary Anderson in 1999 in the conflict-affected development context. The UN PO must strategically expand it to Do Good as the POC mandate itself is for doing good. Though the Action for Peace+ of the SG emphasizes on Systemwise Digital Transformation Strategy as a capacity tool for protection mandate, incorporating early warning and forecasting digital system deserves further consideration.\\nBased on the experiences of more than six decades of engagement of the NA in UN peace missions, it is the right time to holistically review and address the concerns raised in this paper.\\nThe Government of Nepal must expand its engagement with the UN for maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations and promoting social progress, better living standards and human rights, a very foundational aim of creation of the UN. It will be a win-win result for both Nepal and the UN. The following are some of the possible ways forward.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) must focus on expanding its sphere of influence for which we have three major potential areas.\\n\\nFirst, Nepal has a great scope of positioning itself as a champion of global climate change debate because glacier melts and related crisis in the Hindukush Himalayas are global concerns. Hence, Nepal must globally and proactively engage on the issues of climate change and related insecurities.\\nSecond, we have Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha. Nepals meaningful and strategic proactive engagement with Buddhist countries will provide a large number of tourists to Lumbini to noticeably enhance our economy. These two issues are not direct concerns of this paper and I am not going to discuss it further.\\nThe third and the most important one is expanding Nepals engagement in UNPO by a) increasing total number of troops aiming to be the top TPCC, b) providing a higher number of female peacekeepers, c) ensuring more officers in senior positions (eg force commanders) and d) sending civilian experts (eg on rule of law, justice, human rights, women empowerment, ceasefire monitoring, post conflict reconstruction, etc).\\nAchieving these points will not be easy. The MoFA must send capable UN representatives with a higher profile, better negotiation skills, full commitment and a desire to work hard to achieve them. It may require continuous, proactive and meaningful dialogue and negotiation with the UN Secretary General, Security Council and its members, members of General Assembly, and UN representatives of other countries.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Ministry of Defense must work hard to create a favorable domestic environment for achieving the points listed above. The NA has already offered to send 10,000 troops and must be ready and it must be realized as soon as practically feasible. By expanding our peacekeepers, Nepal will gain more experiences and expand the zone of influence in international peace and stability.\\nThe Ministry of Finance must ensure financial provisions for armored personnel carriers (APCs) and other logistics on par with the standard of other TPCCs.\\nThe NA must make sure that the police and soldiers deployed in French and Spanish-speaking countries get language training before their deployment.\\nThe UN in general and UNSG and Department of Peace Operations in particular should categorize member countries into groups regarding the PO:\\nTroops and Police Contributing Countries (TPCCs) (who are providing a large number of troops),\\nCapability Contributing Countries (CCC) who are not providing a significant number of troops. They have to be responsible for capabilities and logistics (like airlifting planes, armored vehicles, training, information and technology, and so on).\\nRegarding the contribution of peacekeepers from Nepal, there is no representation of senior officials proportional to the troops (there are only 6 Force Commanders so far). Therefore, the UN must seriously rethink it and make sure that recruitment of senior officers is commensurate with peacekeepers (also necessary for equity). Nepal has proved and gained international repute as a country committed to upholding the principles outlined in the UN Charter and the UN must, therefore, consider this concern.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the UN as well as the member states, especially resourceful countries who have the responsibility to maintain international peace and stability as per the UN Charter, have to rethink PO in the changing global context and ensure fairness to TPCCs, recognize the contribution of certain countries like Nepal in fulfilling objectives of the UN to keep international peace and stability. Hence, Nepal must provide space to increase peacekeepers, senior officials and civilian officials.',\n",
       " '\\nEvery post has its decorum and dignity. The post of president as a head of state also has its own decorum and dignity. The dignity of that post is related to the duties defined by the Constitution.\\nCompliance and protection of the Constitution shall be the main duties of the President, Article 61(4) of the Constitution states.\\nThe oath of office and secrecy administered to the president also mentions, Remaining completely faithful to the Constitution of Nepalunder prevailing lawswill perform with sincerity.\\nPresident Bidya Devi Bhandari has failed in the main duty prescribed by the Constitution, and destroyed the decorum and dignity of the post of president.\\nThere is a constitutional provision allowing the president to send back any bill submitted for authentication by the sovereign parliament for reconsideration. But the president must authenticate the bill within 15 days if the House again sends it to the president. She did not have any alternative to that and authenticating the Citizenship Bill was her constitutional duty.\\nSome legal professionals have argued that the Citizenship Bill has also automatically become inactive once the term of the House of Representatives (HoR) expired, and the president need not authenticate it. But that is not true.\\nIf the session ends when a Bill is still under consideration, the next session may take over the procedure.\\nProvided that, if a Bill is presented to the House of Representatives and is under consideration, or it is sent to National Assembly after passing it, but if the House of Representatives is dissolved while the Bill is still under consideration in the National Assembly, or if its tenure comes to an end, such Bill shall be considered not effective, states Article 111(10) of the Constitution.\\nThe Citizenship Bill was not under consideration in any House, and was submitted to the president after being endorsed by both the HoR and the National Assembly. The Constitution and laws do not envision any bill passed by both the HoR and the National Assembly becoming inactive. The Constitution, similarly, also does not envision the president not authenticating the bill sent to the president for the second time.\\nThe presidents step, therefore, has raised serious questions about the Constitution and system. Can an individual who does not obey the Constitution continue as president or not? If we assume she can, then it will create a wrong precedent for those becoming president in the coming days. What will happen if a future president also defies any decision taken by the government or the parliament?\\nWe will then be forced to wait anxiously whether the president will authenticate any bill sent after being passed by the House, whether the president will endorse the decision taken by the Cabinet or not. We will, in other words, reach a situation where the president, and not the parliament or the Cabinet with majority in that parliament, will exercise the sovereign powers of the people. That will vitiate our system in an irrevocable manner. That will afflict every prime minister that comes after election in the future and the parliamentary system. Every party that can get into the government will be eventually afflicted.\\nThere is, therefore, the need for rule-based and long-term treatment of the arbitrariness displayed by the president now. One may say The president did not honor the Constitution, we will also not honor the president. Or even inform that the bill automatically comes into effect by publishing it in the Nepal Gazette. But that would be a response in rage. Anger does not make the Constitution and system stronger.\\nIt is necessary to once again move the court to protect the Constitution and system, and to make them stronger, to take the president who has deviated from her responsibilities and constitutional duties to the dock of the court.\\nThe court has already corrected President Bhandari for not fulfilling her constitutional duties appropriately. She had refused to appoint Sher Bahadur Deuba as the prime minister in accordance to Article 76(5) of the Constitution after 149 HoR members wrote to her to that regard defying the rights of the HoR to elect PM. The Supreme Court after a long hearing issued a mandamus instructing her to appoint Deuba as PM and administer oath of office and secrecy within 24 hours.\\nThe SC, definitely, would look at this issue if anyone moves the court demanding that the president be asked to fulfill her constitutional duties. The court has already interpreted clearly that judicial remedy can be sought for presidential acts saying that the provision prohibiting filing of court cases against the president for works done in capacity of the president is limited only up to prohibiting making the president personally liable. But there remains no such limits about examination of the legal validity of the questions raised about use and implementation of the constitutional rights and provisions by the president.\\nThat court verdict adds that no state official remains above the law or beyond the purview of law in a constitutional system incorporating democratic norms and values, and in rule of law. It reminds that keeping all presidential decisions beyond the purview of legal examination would ultimately lead to arbitrariness and autocracy. \\nThis precedent clearly shows that the court can look at the dereliction of the constitutional duty by the president in not authenticating the Citizenship Bill.\\nIt is necessary to take this issue to the court and conclude it there to show constitutional limits to the president who displayed arbitrariness by not authenticating the bill submitted to her after being passed by the parliament, and also to remind her successors about those limits.',\n",
       " \"\\nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has been sending police and staffers with excavators in tow in the Hattisar area, where Tukucha has been put through an underground tunnel, for the past few days. They have been digging the ground in private houses of individuals and companies, demolishing walls, and threatening and instructing the owners to remove the structures. Owners of the houses and the land have been saying they have not encroached the land, rather procured it by completing legal procedures, built houses in accordance to the designs passed by the KMC and acquired documents of completing construction. With documents and evidence in hand, they have been pleading with the KMC to have a look at those documents. But the police and KMC staffers deployed on the field with excavators have not listened to their pleadings. They have been evading the owners saying, Dont tell us, ask engineers, and those above us. And threatening that the houses will be demolished if found above the tunnel through which Tukucha is flowing.\\nA team of police and staffers reached the residence of 82-year-old Sharada Manandhar at Hattisar with excavators on Monday, shut the compound gate that was open, and then brought the gate down with the excavator. She had rented a small truss-structure inside the compound to a coffee house for the past four years. That was an additional source of income on top of her government pension. The KMC ordered her to demolish the structure stating that it is above Tukucha and warned that they will run the excavator if it is not demolished. The tenant has vacated the coffee house after KMCs threats.\\nThe police and KMC staffers are not to blame for all this, and its main leadershipMayor Balen Shahis the one responsible. He doesnt want to check the facts of Hattisar, nor is he ready to listen to the locals. Yogesh Mishra, a local, met Shah at his office armed with documents and evidence, and tried to brief him about the facts but Shah was uninterested in his efforts, Mishra claims.\\nThe KMC has started to display the brutality of excavators instead of looking at the facts and evidence presented by the locals, and presenting its own evidence to show that the locals have encroached the land.\\nWhat is this attitude showed by the KMC leadership, its police and staffers? It is necessary to call and define this mentality for what it is. This is blatant thuggery. The states thuggery over the law-abiding citizens is an unpardonable crime in democracy. And this crime needs to stop immediately.\\nThe facts that we have unearthed, our conversation with locals of Hattisar, and the documents and evidence they have clearly show that they have not encroached the land. This is ancestral property of some; others had legally procured the land only some time back and built houses there. The land there has been sold and procured at government offices for years. Those who have built houses and other structures have done so after passing the design through the KMC and taking permission from other bodies concerned.\\nThe land in Hattisar was never under government ownership. The land was owned by local farmers when the then Rana prime minister Bir Shumsher decided to put the Tukucha flowing out from the southern wall of the Narayanhiti Palace inside a tunnel 130 years ago. Historical documents have proved that the Ranas had acquired the land at Rs 200 per ropani. They constructed the underground tunnel for Tukucha and built a spacious ground by filling the tunnel but they never brought that land under the states ownership. That land was eventually distributed among Bir Shumshers children. Some of the plots there are still owned by Bir Shumshers descendants. Others have been transferred to the current owners after legal transactions.\\nThe most important thing is, the land was surveyed in 1975. The map prepared then does not mention Tukucha. Not many may have remembered the Tukucha that was sent underground more than 80 years earlier. The state may also not have deemed it necessary to keep Tukucha in the map.\\nTo say that the owners should have known about the Tukucha that was never mentioned in government map, and accuse them of encroaching the land over Tukucha and building houses is sheer insanity. The KMC has been doing precisely that now. To try to remove the locals from there through threats and excavator terror without completing any legal process and provision of compensation is an unthinkable act by the state. The Constitution has granted inviolable rights to property for the citizens. The excavators sent by Balen Shah cannot violate that, nor can the state take an ax to the private property of citizens without paying appropriate compensation.\\nThe land and houses are not just physical properties for the people. They are connected with the persons and her familys love, sweat and many memories, and self-respect. The place is beloved for every individual with special importance and prestige. Where does the KMC get the rights to deploy excavators on such places without their permission when they have not committed any offense? Which morality granted that? Those hurting the self-respect of citizens by deploying excavators are liable for punishment in rule of law. Our law also deems attack on others properties a punishable offense.\\nThere seems to be a frightening tendency now. A few individuals seem to be happy when the state has attacked others' properties. It is the nature of the crowd to take sadistic pleasure at the sufferings of others. That is understandable. But another dangerous tendency can also be seen in the Nepali society nownot speaking and writing against wrong deeds of Balen Shah due to his popularity. The victims of Hattisar have met Kathmandu lawmakers and leaders of parties and briefed their grievances. But the leaders have expressed helplessness saying, We cannot speak against Balen Shah at such times.\\nExpressing their helplessness, the victims say, Politicians dont listen to us, the media doesnt write about us. What justice would the court provide during such a time?\\nSome state bodies appear hesitant to fulfill their responsibilities. For example, it has come to light that the Tukucha tunnel was built 130 years ago by Bir Shumsher. Many say it was an amazing example of engineering for that period. The fact that the great earthquakes of 1934 and 2015 could not inflict any damage to the underground tunnel also clearly shows how strong the structure was built. Therefore, it is our heritage of historical and archeological importance that shows the engineering technology of the Rana period. According to law, no structure older than 100 years can be altered or demolished. It can only be altered under the supervision of the Department of Archaeology. The law has given that authority to the Department of Archeology. But the department seems reluctant to fulfill its responsibilities. It has remained silent even when the KMCs excavators have been digging up such an old heritage every day. It has not even bothered to go and inspect the sites of excavation.\\nIf society starts bowing down to populism like this, then democracy will start losing its essence. Therefore, it is necessary to speak and write about this injustice meted out by the KMC to the citizens so that those who are facing injustice do not lose their hope for justice. A democratic society is also a society that puts faith in justice in each other. Those who face the wrath of the state are left alone only in an autocratic society, where everyone fears the state.\\nThankfully, there is also a good side to a populist wavepopulism is usually short-lived. And people in a democratic society will challenge it sooner or later.\\nWhat now?\\nFirst of all, the thuggery needs to be stopped. The KMC needs to bring the excavator terror to an end and stop threatening the citizens.\\nAnd the KMC should discuss the issue with a cool mind in its executive meeting, and take decision in light of the facts that have come to the fore. It should consider whether the Tukucha tunnel has to be demolished or not? The settlement of Hattisar has to be displaced or not? The cost for doing so, the return on the expenses incurred, and whether that can be justified considering other glaring priorities of the KMC?\\nThere will be debate in the media and the civil society on what to do about Tukucha, and whether to revive it or not. People will put their own positions on different aspects of the issue. That is inseparable and essential in a democratic society. That will bring many aspects of the disputed issue to the fore, and help the decision-makers take decision. But the sovereign rights to take a call rest on them in capacity of the elected peoples representatives. The Constitution has provisions specifying what the local government, the provincial government and the federal government can do. Everyone should fulfill ones responsibility accordingly.\\nIf the settlement has to be evacuated, the KMC must hold friendly dialogue with the locals about compensation. They should not be treated like enemies. Both the sides should agree and move forward accordingly. The Government of Nepal should take decision in accordance to the Land Acquisition Act if there is no such agreement, and pay compensation accordingly. And move the works forward.\\nNo government has the authority to ignore the laws, processes and regulations, and unleash excavators on an individuals property taking a mob, threaten the citizens and oppress them. That is not accepted in a civilized and democratic society.\",\n",
       " \"\\nReporting of incidents of sexual assaults in Nepal has increased significantly in the last 10 years. More survivors are opening up as a result of social media's growth and the global #MeToo movement. Such violations have a wider impact than is generally thought. Cases of sexual abuse also have an underlying effect on mental health, in addition to the legal and socioeconomic repercussions. To comprehend how such events worsen survivors' mental health, sufficient research and studies have not been conducted.\\nA 24-year-old girl from Baglung in western Nepal was frequently raped by her father-in-law for a few years. Her husband was abroad for employment during that period. When this incident came out, her father-in-law accused her of infidelity and questioned her character. Though authorities are investigating this matter, her mental health has deteriorated to the point that she has lost most of her senses.\\nDelay in filing cases for these crimes has deteriorated many survivors' mental health, according to journalist Nisha Oli. The majority of survivors take their time opening up. Their mental health is further hampered by this delay.\\nThe road to rehabilitation is not easy, she continues. Most of the time, survivors are unaware of the necessity. Additionally, there are no agencies or groups that serve as mediators to ease the changeover. Although we are not professionals, I have observed various psychiatric issues among survivors. We can only help them along. The predicament is alarming.\\nWhile every instance of sexual abuse is unique, the effects it has on women and girls are often the same.\\nA 25-year-old traumatized survivor is now residing at a hostel in Kathmandu. The abuser has fled, and she is a long way from receiving justice. Her life has been turned upside down. Her life has changed since her mother passed away. Her father soon moved on after getting remarried. She is living alone now that her grandmother has passed away. For her, this was not the end.\\nShe was assaulted at the home of a relative. Nobody believed her. Rather, she was blamed by many. At that point, everything for her was altered. She has been experiencing mental, physical, social, and psychological difficulties for the past nine years. She started to get suicidal tendencies. She spoke about the events in a very frank manner, unlike the majority of survivors.\\nHer attempts to get assistance were unsuccessful. However, neither the police nor the public gave her any credit. She contacted many groups, but none of them were able to assist. Organizations like the National Womens Commission and Maiti Nepal responded in a lukewarm and disappointing manner. They also made fun of her for having mental health issues. They heightened the suffering. Numerous survivors have similar life experiences. Commission employees treat survivors like animals. They torture sufferers instead of offering consolation and compassion. There are numerous instances of survivors who have made it to Anuradha Koirala, the founder of Maiti Nepal, and then returned home sobbing. One of the survivors declared, All that glitters is not gold.\\nMany of the responsible groups have utterly failed in this regard. These groups frequently throw temper tantrums, including berating, requesting that survivors contact the police or bring attorneys, and refusing to offer assistance. The persistent lack of empathy displayed by these institutions hurts the survivors. According to many analysts, social organizations and government entities are found wanting on this issue. Simply put, there is a lack of knowledge, urgency, and priority.\\nJournalist Nisha Oli claims that survivors have access to safe shelters. These safe houses offer lodging, help with processing abortions, and limited therapy. However, there are little long-term benefits from short-term counseling. According to Nisha, counseling should not only concentrate on giving support but also assist in the development of life skills. These skills bring financial independence and respect.\\nA Nepali girl claimed a few months ago on her Instagram and Tiktok pages that she had experienced several rapes and other forms of torture. She went on to say that the trauma caused by these sexual assaults had ruined her life and left her with despair, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\\nShe revealed the abuser's identity and the circumstances she had to deal with after numerous instances of sexual assault in a video that was posted on TikTok and Instagram. There was widespread outrage over this across the nation. Massive rallies and demonstrations demanding justice for her were held in its wake. Her candor inspired many women and girls to talk about their traumatic experiences. The parliament heard debates over the statute of limitations for such crimes.The struggle against sexual assault has gained the much-needed spark.\\nThe case, according to many experts, is just the beginning. The number of sexual assault cases that have been reported has sharply increased in recent years; 2144 and2230 rape cases were reported in the fiscal years 20182019 and 20192020, respectively. There were 981 instances in the fiscal year 20142015, marking a 10-year high for the number. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, 7% of women and girls (1549) nationwide have reported experiencing sexual assault at some point in their lives. Even if the rates are rising, it is believed that they are actually even higher. Many women have been forced to keep such crimes to themselves due to the sensitive nature of crime.\\nDue to survivors' lack of knowledge about their legal rights and the lack of assistance they receive from friends and family, most of such incidents of sexual assault go unreported or remain secret. Instead of demanding retribution from the offender, many times survivors are questioned about their character instead. As a result, the judicial procedure rarely takes place and most of the time, offenders get away scot free.\\nThe mental health support group Umanga Nepal carried out a poll on a small sample of women. Eighteen adolescent girls were surveyed, and the results showed that 15 of them experienced various forms of sexual abuse. Rape, attempted rape, sexual harassment, and sexual misbehavior were all covered. The majority of them experienced maltreatment as children, and they are still traumatized by it. In most cases, family members, friends, coworkers, boyfriends, and strangers were the culprits. Nine of the 18 females experienced abuse in their own homes when aged 10-14 years from family members and neighbors.\\nThe majority of them struggle with anxiety, sleep problems, trauma, and challenges of trust. Their relationships and profession have both been harmed by this. Their confidence and aspirations have been destroyed by the trauma of such an event. Many of the victims have not yet sought legal representation or confronted their abusers. Social hierarchies and taboos are to blame to this. Fears of judgment, marginalization, and victimization are just a few among them. The majority of poll respondents experience guilt, shame, and panic. They are all guilty of self-blame. Survivors of sexual abuse are frequently at risk for mental health problems because of the trauma brought on by such occurrences and the self-deprecating emotions they elicit.\\nSexual-abuse survivors are more prone to experiencing traumatic disorders and trust issues, according to psychotherapist Sita Lama from Mann Ka Kura, who has experience of working with trafficked girls and women. The majority of them are compelled to live with the trauma because they are reluctant to discuss freely about their mental health due to their family history, fear of criticism, and fear of being judged.\\nShe concurs that it takes time for those who have experienced molestation during their formative years or at any other time to open up and find courage. Even if they do open up, they are uncomfortable conversing. In a few instances, people arrive looking for assistance for their friends. But the majority of the time, it's their own tale.\\nEven if they visit us, they are not at ease. Counselors must speak to clients in a way that encourages them to open up and begin believing in us. Some of them crumble and despise their own bodies, she continues.\\nThe slogan, according to Lama, is It's not our fault. Acknowledging pain is the first step on the road to recovery. Dance therapy, behavior therapy, and art therapy can all aid with trauma reduction. However, recovery takes time. It won't happen overnight. Every instruction must be followed. It takes some time to find the wound and heal it.\\nWhen we respect and cherish our bodies, we can communicate with them mentally and emotionally. We are not to blame for anything that has happened to us in the past. In light of this, Lama considers loving and caring for the body to be one of the most crucial tasks.\\nTrauma is merely the beginning of the agony trail. Substance misuse is one of the main effects of such trauma. Most survivors take this route to get away from their experience. One of the survey's survivors related a similar experience. Drunken urges to temporarily flee are very likely. Many survivors still take drugs despite being aware of their negative effects. Unprescribed medications are more hazardous than helpful, as has been universally accepted and empirically demonstrated.\\nSexual assault cases are not limited by gender or color. It has received a lot of discussion and condemnation. Studies and research of various kinds are being conducted. According to a study by Boston-based Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health professor Karestan Koenen, sexual assault and harassment often take a significant long-term toll on a victim's mental and physical health, increasing the risk for not only depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but also high blood pressure and sleep loss.\\nNot everyone who has been assaulted or harassed will endure persistent and lifelong repercussions. Being surrounded by a lot of supportive social networks can be beneficial for some people, she claimed. But a lot of folks aren't, Koenen continued. Many women avoid discussing their experiences with others, often for years, out of concern that they won't be believed or that they would be referred to as nuts or sluts. They, therefore, keep a secret from others, which wears them down over time and prevents them from receiving the assistance they require. Additionally, these encounters are extremely taxing on a bodily and psychological level.\\nSexual assault instances come in a variety of forms, according to Ram Pukar Shah, a clinical psychologist at Kanti Bal Hospital and CEO of the Subha Mangal Group. Some individuals discover the information after the fact.\\nOur conversations are private. We start by getting a better grasp of the clients' behavior, interests, and character attributes. We don't rush because it's a delicate subject and it takes victims a long time to open up. We start by diagnosing the problems, whether they are anxiety, PTSD, or depression.\\nSometimes it's necessary to refer a patient to a psychiatrist and prescribe medicine as well, allowing therapy and medication to work in concert. We try several approaches based on the situation and the severity of the condition. There is therapy for trauma. We have to convince them that they are secure.\\nSome survivors recover on their own with counseling, while others require behavioral therapy. Multiple abuse victims require extra time to recover. However, developing trust with your therapist or counselor is a crucial step.\\nHowever, psychological counseling and therapy are still in their infancy in a nation like Nepal. The industry has come under fire for lacking professionalism and accessibility. Whoever is sincere and nonjudgmental is a true professional, Shah continues.\\n(The Author is a freelance writer and mental health advocate based in Kathmandu, Nepal @RisalShiksha)\",\n",
       " '\\nDipendra Kunwar has been promoted to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of the Armed Police Force (APF) in a way that he is ranked top from his batch.\\nHe has not topped his batch due to his capabilities. He is not only incapable compared to others from his batch but was not even eligible to be recommended for promotion now. But he has been recommended as the highest ranked among his batch mates after pulling strings due to his relation with the political leadership at Baluwatar.\\nKunwar is the husband of Bhanu Deubas sister. Bhanu Deuba is the nephew and personal secretary of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba. Kunwar, who has been recommended for promotion to SSP, in this way is the son-in-law of PM Deuba.\\nHe has been pushed forward in a fraudulent manner in a way that he becomes APF chief in the future because he is a relative of the Deuba family.\\nThe promotion committee under the Home Ministry chaired by the Home Secretary decided to recommend 14 Superintendents of Police (SP) to SSP on Friday. Kunwar has been ranked second overall behind Praveen Kandel, who joined the APF from the Nepal Police and is set to retire soon, and top among his batch mates.\\nThe APF regulation, which required APF personnel to serve for at least four years in a position to become eligible for promotion in the APF, was amended for Kunwars promotion. Kunwar would complete four years as Superintendent of Police (SP) only in April 2023. So, the government amended the regulation on July 6 and changed the eligibility to three years.\\nKunwar had joined the APF as inspector on March 21, 2003. He was ranked toward the bottom of the 74 inspectors of his batch. But he was ranked 10th from among his batch mates when he was promoted to SP from Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), and has now been made top-ranked among his batch mates.\\nBishnu Prasad Bhatta, who was the top-ranked inspector among the 74 from Kunwars batch, has now been ranked behind Kunwar while being promoted to SSP.\\nThe main objective for promoting him now as the top-ranked among his batch mates is to make him Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police first and then Inspector General of Police (IGP).\\nThere are currently three vacancies for DIG in the APF. There is no experience eligibility for DIG as in junior positions and Kunwar will directly become a candidate for DIG as Kandel, who is top-ranked among the newly promoted SSPs, would retire before becoming DIG due to age limit. Kunwar, who is ranked behind Kandel, would be an obvious claimant to IGP.\\nOne must pass staff college to become DIG of the APF. Kunwar has twice failed entrance examinations for staff college. But the APF leadership took a special decision to send him to the staff college of Nepal Army (NA) at Shivapuri for the course even though only the best few APF officers are sent to the Nepal Army staff college. It is, in this way, clearly apparent that he completed staff college due to political backing.\\nSP Kunwars promotion is directly connected to PM Deuba. The PM or his secretariat is at the center of how he has been illegitimately recommended for promotion, that too in a way that he is ranked top among his batch mates.\\nIt is now PM Deubas responsibility to either prove that the facts that have been uncovered about Kunwar now are false or revoke his unlawful recommendation. Deuba is guardian of all those serving the nation through NA, Nepal Police, APF and civil service in his capacity as the executive head of the country. The government led by him cannot mete out injustice to anyone.\\nDeubas responsibility as a PM elected by the people is toward the country and not his family. Democracy is a system of government of the people but all the citizens cannot go to the Singha Durbar and govern as that is not practically possible. The citizens, therefore, should govern through their representatives. The government or the leadership of government, in this manner, is the representative of citizens governing in their stead.\\nIt is the responsibility of those in the leadership to use that for the larger good of the citizens. It is arbitrary to shirk ones responsibility and take any decision for the benefit of oneself or those close to oneself. Arbitrariness of the leadership is unacceptable and unpardonable in democracy.\\nThere is also another side to this.\\nIt is a legitimate expectation of every police officer to be top-ranked if she has performed well, has displayed integrity in behavior, excelled in work, and is more qualified than other contenders.\\nThe issue of promotion to IGP is not just an issue of the governments pleasure but is also an issue of the rights and legitimate expectation of the candidates concerned, reads a Supreme Court verdict curtailing the arbitrariness of the government in IGP appointment.\\nPM Deuba cannot trample on the legitimate expectations of any qualified police officer to promote his relative even now. Display of such arbitrariness by those in the government can harm the police organization in the long run. \\nIf there is no environment where a new officer who has recently joined the police force can expect to become the IGP in the future because she believes she is the best police officer based on her conduct and capabilities, then why would anyone strive to become a good police officer? She will then try to curry favor with politicians and arrange money to offer to higher-ups. What will happen to the security of the country and the citizens then? Discrimination against public servants by every political party and leadership when in power will kill their dreams. That will, in turn, give rise to despair and increase malpractices in police and administration.\\nIt does not suit somebody like PM Deuba, who has even endured life in prison during such a long political career, to promote his relative causing injustice to others. More than that, this is blatantly immoral.\\nWe urge PM Deuba to immediately intervene and revoke the unlawful recommendation for promotion of his relative, protect the rights of other police officers, give them justice and save himself from yet another stain on his name.',\n",
       " '\\nThe issue of grave controversy that Finance Minister Janardan Sharma has been mired is no longer limited to the Finance Ministry. The main responsibility for accountability definitely is Minister Sharmas. But the buck stops with Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba as chairman of the Cabinet and Chairman of Sharmas party Pushpa Kamal Dahal now that Sharma has run away from accountability.\\nIt is now PM Deubas responsibility to either prove that Finance Minister Sharma has not committed any offense or to immediately fire him and conduct an investigation. It is CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Dahals responsibility to take initiative for that or at least support it as Sharma is minister from his party.\\nWe dont know whether the grave allegations against Sharma that unauthorized persons entered the Finance Ministry premises in the midnight and corrected the tax rates in the budget to serve vested interests are true or not.\\nBut after the closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage episode we firmly believe that the issue should not be resolved without judicial or parliamentary investigation. Sharma can return to the ministry if he is proved innocent but he should be liable for legal and political punishment if his involvement in this grave crime is established.\\nThe issue for investigation is simple and clear. Had any unauthorized person entered the Finance Ministry in the midnight a day before the budget was presented in the federal parliament or not?\\nMinister Sharma has publicly claimed that no unauthorized persons entered the Finance Ministry at the time of finalizing the budget. We can give him benefit of doubt, if it can be given at all, only until the investigation on CCTV footage is completed. The investigation will find him innocent or guilty.\\nThe irresponsible response that the Finance Ministry has given stating that the CCTV footage can be retained only for 13 days in the right to information (RTI) request filed by a citizen seeking footage of the ministry at the alleged time of crime has made this issue graver.\\nThere are two sides of the CCTV footage episode. The first is the right of citizens for access to and surveillance of the works done by the state. The second is the responsibility of the Finance Ministry to keep the CCTV footage safe for at least three months. \\nNepal has formulated law related to RTI. The spirit of that law is clearthe citizens have the right for surveillance of any work done by the state, any state organ or any official in that organ in a democratic country. They can seek information related to that in writing.\\nThe right of such surveillance of the politicians elected by the people and who are remunerated by the taxes paid by them is fundamental in a democratic system. It is the duty of every politician to be sensitive toward the right granted to the citizens by the law and comply with it. They cannot shirk from their responsibility.\\nThe RTI has been granted considering that politicians or any authorized person can take decision in a dark room against public interest for self-interest of them or others to ensure that they can make such decisions public and resist against those decisions.\\nThe citizens have been fulfilling their responsibilities toward democracy by electing politicians through their votes even in the most adverse conditions on the one hand. They have also been bearing the financial burden of keeping the state functioning by paying taxes despite the financial difficulties they face on the other. \\nIt is, therefore, necessary to imbibe that the rights of citizens for surveillance of the state and politicians is inviolable. \\nHow important the issue of a citizen seeking CCTV footage of the Finance Ministry automatically becomes clear once one accepts this basic tenet. It is legal and moral responsibility of the Finance Ministry leadership to provide the footage sought completing legal procedures. The ministry has shirked from this responsibility by giving a written response that the ministrys CCTV footage can be retained only for 13 days. \\nThe Home Ministrys guidelines about installation and operation of CCTV requires footage of CCTV cameras be kept safe for at least three months and adds that the district administration office concerned can investigate about the CCTV footage. The footage of May 28, therefore, should be kept safe at least until August 28.\\nThe gravity of allegations against Minister Sharma has increased further after the ministrys response that it does not have the footage of the final night before the budget was presented in the House. He should not be exonerated of this episode without investigation which should start by immediately removing him as minister.\\nTechnological experts can retrieve the footage even if it has been lost. The wrong intentions would be automatically proved if the footage has been deleted in an irretrievable manner.\\nPM Deuba and Maoist Center Chairman Dahal do not have the luxury of ignoring this episode. Their support for Sharma, if not implication, will be clearly established if they do so.',\n",
       " '\\nDuring the monsoon season, almost every day, we wake up to some hazardous events such as landslides and floods and their devastating impact on people and society. Over the last decade Nepal experienced a number of major floods, landslides, windstorms, lightnings, public health-related and other monsoon hazards that caused loss of lives and livelihoods. This explains the diversity of hazards that Nepal faces and underscores the importance of more predictable and accountable disaster management.\\n2022 monsoon outlook and preparedness\\nThe National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) estimates around two million people can be potentially affected by the monsoon hazards in 2022. Based on this caseload all three levels of governmentfederal, provincial, and localtogether with humanitarian partners including the private sector have been engaged in preparedness and readiness activities to effectively respond to the potential monsoon disasters.\\nHowever, there are questions about effective implementation of such plans and policies. For example, when there is a disaster, provisions on such plans are overlooked. All the disaster management committees at local, district, provincial and federal levels convene and take some generic decisions. Often there is redundancy in the decisions and no follow-up. Coordination with other relief providers such as volunteer groups, private sector and civil society is ad-hoc. In the name of one-door policy, relief activities are held up. Often relief workers find it difficult to navigate the complexities and reach to the population in need of support.\\nFunds and materials get allocated. There is never a serious shortfall, but the governance mechanism which is needed most during the time of crisis becomes more confusing. Whenever there is a disaster situation everybody in the bureaucracy and the political system, from ward member to the prime minister, gets engaged, says Krishna Lamichhane, a Red Cross worker in Nawalparasi of Lumbini province. They try to politically capitalize on the humanitarian situation and make a trip to the affected site. But real relief work takes a hit. Lamichhane believes empowering front-line Red Cross network would improve delivery.\\nFront-line governance\\nAn accountable and predictable approach is required to timely protect lives and livelihoods from hazards and ensure effective disaster response. The Constitution of Nepal has entrusted the local bodies with an exclusive jurisdiction and responsibilities in disaster management. The local officials including elected ward officials, police, health workers and Red Cross are the first responders and manage the relief efforts in the critical early hours of response.\\nGiven their detailed knowledge of the community, the local bodies are best able to identify hazards, assess vulnerabilities and design appropriate policies to reduce and manage risks. Local officials are well positioned to spearhead disaster preparedness planning. Moreover, many practical local measures can be implemented at the local level to ensure disasters are managed locally as much as possible and nationalized only when it is necessary.\\nAlthough local bodies bear primary functional responsibility for disaster management, local capacity particularly in disaster response is weak. The local bodies lack own search and rescue workers and technical expertise. The district authorities, which are federal government entities, maintain the capability in search and rescue, and support the local bodies. Post-disaster analyses essentially reveal that local disaster management capacities are weak and underfunded.\\nIn addition to the technical capabilities, local decision-making process has to be effective and efficient. The governance mechanism has to be facilitating and coordinating in responding to disasters or other problems in the society, says Deputy Mayor of Rajapur Municipality in Bardiya Mankala Kumari Chaudhary. She emphasizes that necessary guidelines, protocols and standards have to be developed and updated by the government. To have predictability in governance, there must be accountability of the elected officials and the institutions and partnership with wide range of actors in the society.\\nTransforming traditional governance to anticipatory approaches\\nGiven the unpredictability in hazards, the country needs to move away from the traditional form of reactive approach to more anticipatory approaches. The anticipatory approaches are the ability to harness the collective intelligence and wisdom of collaborating with organizations and citizens. According to Leon Fuerth (2009), anticipatory governance is a system of institutions, rules and norms that provide a way to use foresight for the purpose of reducing risk and to increase capacity to respond to events at early rather than later states of their development.\\nBetter disaster preparedness and anticipatory governance could be achieved by emphasizing readiness for all types of hazards and involving multiple dimensions including mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.\\nNepal has started practicing anticipatory governance approach in disaster management one way or the other. For instance, the government, security forces and other partners annually organize simulation and drill exercises before the onset of monsoon season. These exercises are important in diagnosing shortfall in disaster response plan and mechanisms and help in fostering strong working relationships among the responders.\\nThe Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has been providing three-day and the long-range forecasts. Based on these weather forecasts, authorities disseminate early warning messages to the communities. The local governments and relief organizations are able to implement some preventive and mitigative measures before there is a flood.\\nAlso, there is an ongoing discourse on strict implementation of land use policy to reduce the impacts of hazards. The land use regulations that prohibit construction on risky land such as flood plains contribute to averting the disaster. Traditionally, the community and its leaders have set norms and rules on the land use and zoning of land. The land was classified based on its nature and topography. But these days with boom in real estate every piece of land, even dangerously sloping land, is being bulldozed, says Khagendra Pant, local high school teacher in Bhajani, Kailali.\\nThe NDRRMA is leading scenario-based preparedness which involves analyzing underlying risk and vulnerabilities to different hazards and developing caseloads. The authority asks different ministries, departments and partners to prepare a plan based on those scenarios and caseloads. It also involves measuring a communitys capability to respond effectivelysuch as planning for the evacuation sites for people living with disability. The NDRRMA has embraced the principles of risk management in its disaster preparedness and response approach. Risk-based emergency planning involves assessment of the risk a community is likely to face, and estimation of probable impacts associated with these risks over a specific period. The process of identifying, analyzing and prioritizing risk is increasingly regarded as the optimal means to allocate scarce emergency management resources.\\nCall to action\\nThe underlying risk posed by the climate change and unpredictability in the hazard patterns warrant anticipatory governance to take preventative and mitigating approaches in saving lives and livelihood. Its high time we made disaster response and recovery work more predictable, accountable, and responsive. With these unprecedented challenges, the policy development requires speed. Some policies must be developed and updated within a short period of time. The scope of the policy work and problem of the communities need to be adequately diagnosed. Additionally, resources from each level of government should be brought to the table and inter-governmental collaboration should be forged. This is how a system that is able to respond to the unexpected crises arising from climate change can be built.\\nTo make disaster response anticipatory, a multi-hazard early warning system has to be put in place.

       " '\\nThe politics is heated in the past few days due to the State Partnership Program (SPP) of America. Facts and lies alike regarding the SPP have come to the fore.\\nForeign Minister Narayan Khadkas comments about the SPP in the House, the US Embassys briefing to journalists, the statement issued by the Nepal Army (NA) and speeches by politicians in accordance with their interests have created confusions instead of clarifying about SPP.\\nThe US Embassy invited journalists and stated that no draft of SPP agreement has been submitted to the Government of Nepal. It also claimed that Nepal had applied to participate in SPP in 2015 and 2017, and the application was approved in 2019.\\nThe then Nepal Army (NA) Chief Rajendra Chhetri had applied for partnership on both the occasions and the NA had copied both the applications to the Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of Nepal, according to the US Embassy.\\nThe NA issued a statement Wednesday evening claiming that no agreement or understanding has been signed about the SPP. \"The Nepal Army has not signed any agreement or understanding about the SPP with the US Army or government, and there is no process toward signing such agreement,\" the NA statement says. \"The Nepal Army is always clear about the objective fact about not doing military partnership in the future with anyone in a way that can adversely affect the non-aligned foreign policy adopted by Nepal and Nepal\\'s special geopolitical location and strategic sensitivities.\"\\nThe NA statement has mentioned that no agreement or understanding has been signed about the SPP but it has not spoken about the claims of the US Embassy that it had first applied for participation in 2015 and then again in 2017.\\nNo agreement needs to be signed to participate in the SPP going by what the US Embassy says. Interested countries apply for participation and America accepts the application.\\nThe Government of Nepal should now inform the House about all the facts related to SPP issuing a white paper. The issue will continue to create suspicions otherwise. It will become an issue for political one-upmanship and allegations and counter-allegations.\\nThe NA must have copies of the applications submitted by the then NA Chief Chhetri in 2015 and 2017. The US Embassys claims that both the applications were also copied to the Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of Nepal hint that the two ministries also have copies of the applications. The letter that Chhetri had sent in 2015 when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister (PM) has been made public Thursday.\\nBut the letter said to have been sent in 2017 has yet to be made public and what exactly was written in that letter has yet to be known. America has said that it allowed Nepal to join the SPP in 2019 on the basis of these two applications.\\nThe Government of Nepal should seek answers from America if the intention of those two letters was not to become part of the SPP and ask for removal of Nepals name from its website.\\nThe government and the NA cannot be irresponsible and just say that they have not signed any agreement when America has listed Nepal as a member country of the SPP.\\nWhat may actually have happened is the NA asked for help from the US Army in disaster management after the Gorkha Earthquake in 2015. It may have applied for the SPP after the US Army likely responded that such assistance can be provided after receiving application for the SPP. The NA may again have applied in 2017 for similar assistance.\\nWe dont believe that the NA or the government led by any politician will knowingly decide to enter a long-term military partnership with America. Nobody seems to be in a state to definitively say about all the aspects related to the SPP today. Politicians, be those inside the government or in the opposition, seem more confused. They, however, are resorting to allegations and counter-allegations against each other even in this confusion. They are spending the time they should invest on understanding the issue and unearth the facts in making allegations.\\nCPN-UMLwhich has been the loudest in raising questions about the SPP both inside the House and outside to try to show that it is the only nationalist party, and create doubts about patriotism of othersis in an awkward position after it has been revealed that the first application for participation in the SPP was sent when the party led the government.\\nCPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal seems to be in haste to allege that Oli made the deal as he led the government when America accepted Nepals application in 2019.\\nThis nature of our politicians to resort to inflammatory allegations and counter-allegations on sensitive national issues instead of displaying appropriate gravity and sensitivity is not new. The allegations that politicians knowingly or unknowingly have levelled against each other since 1951 about nationalism and foreign policy have made Nepal weak in the eyes of foreigners the most. Leaders and parties are unfortunately repeating the same irresponsibility and rhetoric even on the issue of SPP.\\nWe believe the politicians who try to depict only themselves as nationalists and always attack on patriotism and integrity of others, and publicly slander others calling them brokers are fake nationalists.\\nThe need of the hour is to find out truth and facts about the SPP, make them public and conclude the issue forging national unity. The SPP is not merely a program for the US Army to assist other countries in issues including disaster management as claimed by the US Embassy and Foreign Minister Khadka in the House. Those things are also part of the SPP but the SPP is more than that.\\nAn article about the main objectives of the SPP by a former chief of the American National Guard that cooperates with armies of different countries clarifies how broad the SPPs scope is and what its main objectives are.\\nThis definitely does not mean that the NA should not establish any relations with the US Army. The NA has relations with the armies of India, China, US and other countries for years. The NA participates in joint exercises with the Indian and Chinese armies every year. It also holds joint drills with the US Army.\\nThe US Army has been providing training to the NA on disaster management, search and rescue, counter-terrorism and other areas. NA officials go to American war colleges and other organizations for studies and training on a regular basis. This practice had been continuing even before Nepal applied for the SPP.\\nWhat necessitated Nepals application for the SPP in recent years? How can we be assured that this application incorporates only these areas of cooperation between the NA and the US Army? Who will give the assurance?\\nNepal cannot, and must not, enter the wide spectrum of partnership between the two armies under the SPP. On the one hand, we have our geopolitical sensitivity, and we have our constitutional commitment and responsibility toward non-aligned foreign policy on the other. If we follow the simple formula of aligning with all world powers on matters of economy and development while remaining non-aligned on strategic matters, it will not only help us achieve economic gains but also protect us from strategic tensions and risks.\\nAre the common people expecting too much from the political parties if they want all political parties to consign their past invectives against each other to history and stand together. If not, let us first make public all the facts related to the SPP through a white paper in the sovereign parliament. After that, let all the major political parties reach an agreement on how to resolve the issue of SPP.\\nLet the series of abusing and doubting each other on the issue of nationalism and foreign policy be stopped. Let us make Nepal a mature country that does not harm anyone, strongly stand for her interests, participates with everyone economically but remain strategically non-aligned in the eyes of our neighbors and friendly countries.\\nAre the politicians ready for that?',\n",
       " \"\\nThe committee formed by the government to invstigate the allegations made against Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari reminds of kangaroo courts that autocrats across the world form to persecute their opponents and rivals.\\nFinance Minister Janardan Sharma has got Adhikari suspended by influencing Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba due to his ego and prejudice, and got a committee formed through the Cabinet to investigate Adhikari.\\nSharma has not been able to publicly defend suspension of governor of an autonomous body like the NRB. Governors are not generally suspended unless they show serious moral depravity or knowingly harm the country. They must never be suspended on the basis of policy differences.\\nThe NRB can adopt a policy that differs from that of the government based on the needs of the economy. Political parties can disrupt the country's economy in accordance to their short-term interests or political needs. The NRB has been given autonomy precisely to ensure that it can pay attention to stability of the economy through monetary policy to stop that. \\nGovernor Adhikari had implemented the NRB policies in coordination with the government policies even in practice. The NRB and the government coordinate their policies at normal times and the finance secretary is kept in the NRB board for that purpose.\\nAdhikari has not acted to harm the economy defying the government or flouting government's instructions. He instead intervened and prevented hike in interest rate for a long time to fulfill the finance minister's wish to increase loan investment by banks keeping a low interest rate, and raise economic activities and the economic growth rate. That is seen to have increased flow of cheap money into the economy, increased import and put pressure on foreign currency reserves now.\\nSome policies adopted with good intention can prove to be wrong in the long run and put pressure on the economy. No economy would suffer crisis if all the policies were proved right and accurate prediction of a crisis were possible. There is no country in the world that has never suffered an economic crisis. All the state organs, therefore, should have come together to find a solution to the problem currently facing our economy without blaming anyone.\\nFinance Minister Sharma instead has alleged Adhikari of not cooperating with the government, harming the economy, leaking important economic information among others to avenge on an absolutely different issue.\\nIt is not hidden from anyone that Sharma has attacked Adhikari after revelations that he took initiative to release the money transferred in the name of Prithvi Bahadur Shah from America that the NRB has frozen after America requested the central bank to investigate and return the amount back to America suspecting that it may have arrived through money laundering or fraud. To take an initiative to release the amount that has been red-flagged by America was a serious mistake on part of the finance minister.\\nThat he got the governor suspended suspecting that Adhikari leaked the information and a committee formed including persons close to him to investigate that shows that he is intent on practicing vigilante justice.\\nThe kind of persons included in the 'kangaroo committee' formed on initiative of Sharma gives away what his intentions are. The committee that Sharma has got constituted through the Cabinet including a former justice who is his relative and two party cadres has ended the possibility of fair investigation of allegations made against the governor and chances for justice.\\nConstitution of such 'kangaroo committee' has made mockery of justice. Responsibility for that now lies not just with Sharma but Chairman of the Cabinet that formed the 'kangaroo committee' and his party Nepali Congerss (NC). Neither PM Deuba nor NC can now run away from that.\\nPractising 'kangaroo court' and vigilante justice is not new for the Maoists that had practiced so during the armed insurgency. But how could NC agree for that? It should declare whether any citizen has the right for fair investigation of allegations made against her in a liberal and democratic society it has promised to the people. Whether that is a fundamental right for any citizen in today's Nepal or not? If yes, why is that right of Governor Adhikari denied? How could a Cabinet meeting attended by PM Deuba form such a 'kangaroo committee' on whims of Minister Sharma? On what basis the Deuba Cabinet endorsed such a decision that attacks the autonomy granted to the NRB and its governor by the law?\\nThese questions raised against PM Deuba and NC led by him are not simple. This Cabinet decision to form the 'kangaroo committee' attacks the very trust that the people have on NC for the kind of values and norms it swears allegiance to.\\nThe only way to correct the mistake now is to revoke the 'kangaroo committee' and withdraw the suspension of Governor Adhikari.\\nNC should mull whether the public trust on it for its values and norms is important or transient interests of ruling coalition and defnse of the finance minister's whims are?\",\n",
       " \"\\nSurgery is considered as one of the very rewarding disciplines providing good amount of personal and professional job satisfaction. Unfortunately, it is also considered as one of the most stressful professions. Both during the period of surgical training as well as clinical practice, people are prone to developing burnout due to excessive stress. Predisposing factors could be multiple. Multiple studies published overseas have demonstrated that the burnout rate among the surgical trainees and practicing surgeons is very high in comparison to other specialties.\\nWhy surgeons are prone to stress?\\nIn surgical specialties, the job demands extreme amount of hard work, both mentally and physically. Besides this, the working hours are extra-long and just not limited to fixed schedules, and the on-call duties are extremely tiring and long. Most of the times the surgeons are dealing with life-and-death situations and one small error either in judgment or skill can prove fatal. At some busy centers the surgeons are overloaded with patients too. Moreover, the training in surgical specialties is extremely prolonged and even after completing their general and specialty trainings they further need supervised working environment to gain good amount of exposure and develop enough confidence. Each individual surgeon can work independently only after that. These prolonged period of training leads to disbalance in their professional and personal life. Similarly, the compulsion to excel both in academics and surgical practice as well as trying to balance with economical aspects are important factors leading to development of burnout among surgeons. Failure to achieve balance in academic, clinical practice and personal life is again the most important factor for the development of stress among surgeons. Sometimes the pressure on the surgeons by the administration to increase performance also adds up the stress among the surgeons who are already prone to stress because of various predisposing factors. Increasing possibility of dealing with litigations in surgical practice is also one of the strongest factors for surgeons to experience stress and develop burnouts.\\nWhat is the prevalence of stress among surgeons?\\nApart from some anecdotal reports and expert viewpoints, there has been no published study on this subject matter in Nepal till date. This is one of the very important areas to be researched in Nepal as surgical training and clinical practice in surgical specialties are increasingly becoming very challenging and competitive, and also invite risk of litigations. The number of surgeons in the country has also significantly increased. One US study published in Surgery journal in 2001, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, did a survey on 582 surgeons. Overall, 32% surgeons showed high levels of emotional exhaustion, 13% depersonalization and 4% showed low sense of personal accomplishment. Young surgeons were found to be more vulnerable to suffering stress. Similarly, another Australian study published in ANZ journal of Surgery in 2007 evaluated 126 Surgeons. They found that the surgeons were suffering high level of burnout than the general population. Around 48% of the surgeons surveyed reported high burnout levels. Besides these published reports, there are plenty of otheroverseas publications supporting the fact that the surgeons are very prone to developing burnout and suffering from stress. It has also been found that the experienced surgeons are more likely to have higher management ability as compared to those younger ones and with fewer years of experience.\\nWhat is the effect of stress among surgeons?\\nBurnout and stress can spill over to personal and professional life. Burnouts can lead to emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and low personal accomplishment. Besides this, stress can be significant contributor to poor health of a surgeon. Anxiety and depression can both be a reason for serious health issues among very stressed and burnt out surgeons. Suffering from broken relationships to drug and alcohol dependence can be a serious issue and at extreme situations they are also prone to suicidal tendencies in lack of timely intervention. Stress and burnout lead to imbalance between personal and professional life which further adds to the suffering of already stressed surgeons and this vicious cycle can continue. Job performance further deteriorates in those surgeons already under stress. This can in fact affect the outcome of the patients being treated. Thus, stress and burnouts have serious consequences which are not just limited to the surgeon suffering from it but also can affect the patient being treated and overall health services of a center.\\nHow can we prevent that?\\nDespite the high prevalence of stress and burnout among surgeons, there are still ways to reduce italthough it cant be completely avoided. There is no best way to prevent it because it needs to be individualized based on every individuals working condition, environment, job responsibilities and personalities besides many other factors to be considered. There are plenty of ways described in various published literatures to reduce and prevent stress among surgeons and surgical trainees which could in fact be applied to any other specialty too. The past experience of handling the stressful situation can be adopted even during surgical training periods and in clinical practice too. Identifying priorities both in personal and professional life is a must. One should understand and know one's limits as to what extent to be devoted to surgery. It may not be very applicable during training but definitely an important issue to be considered while practicing as a professional surgeon. Not everyone can do everything and one should understand one's limits and potential. Getting inspired from others is definitely rewarding but comparing oneself to others can unnecessarily increase the stress. Trying to balance between clinical, academic and personal life which also includes the financial aspects is a must. Running after one single aspect is definitely going to be non-rewarding and there is possibility of developing stressful situation due to self-understood reasons. Working in a team, sharing responsibilities and asking for help whenever required are of utmost importance in preventing stress and burnout among surgeons. A very supporting family can definitely help dealing with stressful situations. However, not everyone could be lucky enough to have a very understanding family or a colleague. Reading articles, publications and books on stress management can also help significantly. For those having a concerning level of stress and burnouts participation in formal stress management training programs and also getting timely medical interventions can help. From the administrative perspective, imposing scientifically correct working hours and workloads both on trainees and practicing surgeons can help avoid unnecessary stress and decrease burnouts among these vulnerable population.\\nIn conclusion, surgery is a very rewarding yet stressful discipline due to various reasons and surgeons both as trainees and practicing surgeons are prone to developing burnout and suffering stress. This can have various consequences not just limited to individual but also affecting the whole system. Thus, efforts should be made at the individual level to the level of administrators and stakeholders to prevent and reduce the prevalence of stress and burnout among surgical trainees and practicing surgeons which then will help in creating a safe working environment for service providers as well as increasing the patient safety.\\n(The author is liver and gastro surgeon and profesor at the TUTH)\",\n",

       " '\\nThe context\\nPublic policy in general is conceptual roadmap for government to address specific public concerns and/or deliver specific constitutional mandates and it provides framework for ensuring legal, institutional, procedural, and resources (both human and financial) required to deliver the commitments of the particular public policy. Effectiveness of Nepals public polices has to be examined within this definitional framework.\\nFor the past two years, I am heavily engaged in reviewing public polices, comparing different existing public polices and reviewing several new draft polices prepared by different ministries and government agencies. This process helped to understand how they are formulated, why they are formulated in that particular way, how effective they are implemented and why they fail. In this article I am reflecting on why public polices often fail in Nepal.\\nReasons of public policies failure \\nI found the following major reasons of ineffectiveness or even failure of public polices in Nepal:\\n\\nWeakness in the policy formulation process: Lack of proper need assessment and weak prioritization, no sincere risk and opportunities assessment, not even proper definition of policy, no proper consultation with key stakeholders to collect their concerns and voices resulting in lack of ownership, very top-down process leading to few formal activities to meet the legal/procedural requirement, time pressure for quick delivery of policy, etc. Right policy formulation process often leads to higher possibility for effective implementation and vice versa. Hence, one of the major reasons of failure of public policy is lack of adopting right process.\\n\\n\\nInconsistencies in content of policy formulation: Once there is lack of proper need identification, analysis and prioritization, appropriate risk assessment, lack of conceptual clarity in absence of definition, there is always possibility of inconsistencies and flaws/vagueness in the content. Because of lack of conceptual clarity, the whole document as well as individual policy statement is called policy. Many times the logical sequencing between a) policy statement, b) strategies and c) implementing guidelines are weak or missing, very vague statements with similar meaning are presented in policy statements, strategies and implementing guidelines.\\n\\n\\nInstitutional mechanism: In most of the polices, there is no clear responsibilities of responsible institutions outlined and agreed, thereby creating confusion and lack of ownership in implementation. Most of the polices require engagement of several inter-ministerial institutions. Policies brought by one ministry with the responsibilities of implementation on another ministry is one of the main reasons for dysfunction.\\n\\n\\nLegal provisions: Several policy provisions demand legal back up for successful implementation. But most of the polices are prepared without proper assessment of legal situation (does any existing law inhibit implementation, is new law required to implement the policy etc.). Hence, once policy is formulated, many existing laws prohibit (e.g., forest law or park and people law) implementation or new laws are required. This situation must be assessed while making policy and clear legal provisions required to implement specific policy must be outlined in the policy. Further, unlike laws, there is no provision of punishment to concerned officials if he or she fails to implement particular policy resulting in impunity for lack of implementation.\\n\\n\\nCoordination: Lack of inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination is another big barrier to implementing policy effectively, as scope of most of the policies (e.g., agriculture policy, urban development policy, water, sanitation and hygiene policy, etc.) goes beyond the remit of single ministry (eg, agriculture, irrigation, industries, trade and supply, finance, foreign affairs, home affairs ministries are related with agriculture policy). Hence, if proper consultation with concerned ministers at the beginning of policy formulation is not done and clear commitment not ensured, policy will not work.\\n\\n\\nResources provisions: Many policies at the time of formulation do not assess the tentative financial and human resources requirements. Without proper projection of resources required for implementing the policy, possibility of its failure is high.\\nTime required for public policy formulation: Often Nepals public policies are formulated in a very short time (few weeks to hardly a few months) leaving aside important public consultation process because of pressure from minsters leading ultimately to lack of public ownership and failure. Depending on the gravity of topic, time span for a policy formulation process requires nine months and up to 10 years (for policies that are directly related with a large number of people, such as agriculture/health and sanitation, etc.).\\n\\n\\nMonitoring and evaluation: Most of the policies mention about monitoring and evaluation but there are no indicators (what to monitor/evaluate), no time frame (when to do), and assigning of responsibility. So, it remains simply a jargon statement.\\n\\n\\nSupplementary elaborations and documents: Complex polices require supplementary documents (strategies, guidelines, procedures etc.) that are not indicated in the policies but affect policy implementation.\\n\\nWay ahead\\nExisting practice of policy formulation must be changed if we want to see public policy implemented. In this context, Policy Research Institute (PRI) has developed two guidelines related to public polices: one related to formulation of public polices and another related to reviewing public policies, to assist government ministries. Very brief synopsis of public policy formulation cycle is presented below:\\nPublic Policy Formulation to follow the Public Policy Formation Cycle that starts with\\n\\nidentification and analysis of policy issues,\\nprioritization of policy issues,\\npreliminary draft as per the standard format (developed by Policy Research Institute),\\ncall for the public to give feedback and public dialogue over the preliminary draft,\\nrevision of the preliminary draft based on the public feedback,\\nreview of the revised draft by team of experts and adaptation of draft,\\ncirculation at the public level for their comments and feedback on the draft (sending to all key stakeholders and requesting for their feedback and organization of a series of feedback meetings with stakeholders),\\nrevision of the draft policy for finalization,\\nsubmission of the draft to cabinet committee for approval,\\npolicy implementation,\\npolicy evaluation (after 5 years of implementation) and decision of continuity, revision or need for new policy.\\n\\nCompletion of this process generally requires about nine months and in case of policies dealing with the concerns of large population such as health policy, agriculture policy, drinking water and sanitation policies and education policies years of continuous consultation and public debate is required. Now Nepal needs to change the present practice of policy formulation in terms of process, content, expected outcomes.\\n(The author is currently serving as executive chairperson of the Policy Research Institute, a government think tank)',\n",
       " \"\\nThe country is currently polarized over the US$ 500 million grant the American government is providing through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The MCC Compact signed between Nepal and America four years ago have yet to come into implementation in lack of ratification by the House.\\nThe American government has already said that the amount will be given to another country if the MCC Compact is not ratified by the House by February end. The act of picking controversy over a grant agreement with a friendly nation four years after signing the agreement shows how pathetic and irresponsible our diplomacy is. Such an important issue that needs to be discussed in the House has not even been taken to the House.\\nThe dispute, therefore, has reached the streets and even the dining table of the people. The politicians stayed mere spectators instead of becoming serious about such an important issues related to the country's future. This further compounded matters. The MCC Compact should be tabled in the House without any delay and lawmakers should take a decision using their wisdom.\\nThe then prime minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli had registered the MCC for discussion in the House when he led the CPN government. But the then speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara did not allow discussion in the House on instruction of Pushpa Kamal Dahal who was chairman of ruling CPN along with Oli.\\nAgni Sapkota, who shares Maoist background with Mahara, also did not hold discussion amidst power struggle inside CPN after he became speaker. He did not just deny the government the right to take any bill or proposal of its choice to the House but also obstructed exercise of the sovereign right of the lawmakers elected by the people to hold discussion on those issues. This is unpardonable on the part of Sapkota in capacity of speaker. Speaker Sapkota should now take the MCC Compact for discussion without any excuse and delay. Whether to end the House obstruction for discussion or not is up to CPN-UML. He cannot shirk his responsibility pointing at UML.\\nMany political leaders have been irresponsible on the issue of MCC. CPN (Maoist Center) Chair Dahal has been the most irresponsible among the top leaders. He generally has a dual position on any issue. He has this habit of saying one thing one day and exactly the opposite the next day on any issue irrespective of gravity of the issue. He unfortunately swung like a pendulum even on the issue of MCC and bilateral relation with America.\\nHe made a sensitive issue like MCC a tool for his power struggle inside the party in the beginning. He had said the MCC Compact will be ratified by the House in Kantipur Conclave a few years back. But he first used Mahara and then Sapkota, and stopped MCC's entry in the House as his relation with Oli soured.\\nNepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba had asked Dahal about the MCC Compact before forging the alliance to unseat Oli from pemiership. Deuba actually wanted to form the coalition government only after getting the MCC Compact ratified. Dahal had promised his party's support to pass the MCC Compact after forming the coalition government. But Dahal started to make conflicting remarks about MCC once the new government was formed. He claimed that he is not in favor of passing it inside his party even as he swore his support for the agreement with American officials. He told Deuba that he needs more time to convince comrades inside his party.\\nDahal penned a joint letter to the MCC on September 29, 2021 along with PM Deuba after American officials said they will take back the amount if it is not endorsed by the House, and sought four-five months to create a favorable environment for MCC inside his party and in the country. He also promised to get the MCC Compact ratified in his official meetings with American officials in the intervening period. He did not raise the issue of amending the agreement in the joint letter sent to the MCC or during the multiple meetings with American officials. But he continued to tell leaders inside his party that the MCC Compact cannot be passed without amendment. So much so that he got the party's stance endorsed by the recent general convention.\\nHow can a top leader of a major party and a former PM act so irresponsibily? The country has suffered a huge loss due to his dual character. But he himself and his party has suffered an even greater loss due to that. Dahal continued to sell the dream of rebellion and state capture to the rank and file even after he gave up the armed rebellion and joined peaceful politics. He mentally sailed the two boats of peace and rebellion.\\nHe and his party would have been in a far better position in Nepali politics now had he focused on transforming his party for peaceful politics and seeking resolution to the political, social and economic issues facing the country through the House right from the beginning. He has not even imagined the harm the dual nature he is showing now on the issue of MCC has incurred for him. He will face the consequences if he does not mend his ways.\\nThe main opposition UML has also resorted to politicking on the issue of MCC in recent times. UML has put the party's interests above that of the country's even though it may not be as shameless as Dahal's. As the issue of MCC gets trickier, there is risk of conflict of powerful countries intensifying inside Nepal and the country getting in a geopolitical tangle. That is not an issue of concern for just one party.\\nIf all the parties come together, we cannot just evade the potential geopolitical mess but also have the opportunity of moving forward with a foreign policy based on a balanced relations with all the powerful countries. The country currently needs cognizance and cooperation from all the parties. But UML is busy counting its political gains and losses.\\nSetopati has always been clear on the issue of ratifying the MCC Compact. America definitely may have its strategic interest in the MCC just as China may have in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI|) and India in any other development project. But Nepal has not done any strategic deal in the MCC Compact it has signed. We will be bound only by the MCC Compact in the coming days. The issues mentioned in the MCC Compact are purely related only to development projectsconstruction of transmission lines essential for Nepal, and repair and maintenance of the roads.\\nThere are many reasons for the issues in the agreement being dragged into controversy. Many do not know anything about this agreement. They have not even read the agreement but are opposing it on the basis of hearsay. Some are opposing in lack of understanding about how international treaties and agreements are drafted and their meaning. Some are not familiar about the language used in deals about development projects and are opposing it. Still others are opposing by misinterpreting the meaning of English language used in the agreement. And some are opposing it due to their prejudice.\\nThe MCC Office has already sent written response to all the questions raised about the MCC. The MCC Compact itself has a provision allowing both Nepal and America to unilaterally revoke the deal giving a 30-day notice if they have any grievances regarding implementation of the Compact. We will always reserve the rights to walk away from the agreement giving a 30-day notice if Nepal does not agree with anything or America puts pressure to that regard after the MCC Compact comes into implementation. We must, therefore, get the MCC Compact ratified through the House and take it into implementation without any apprehension. \\nSetopati is also clear about the issue of geopoliitcs. Nepal will have to maintain cordial and close relation with all the neighboring and powerful countries, and use that to our benefits.\\nWe should not oppose any country for the sake of another, and not allow any to interfere in the relation with another. India wanted Nepal to not sign the BRI and had even quietly lobbied for that. We had said we should sign the BRI with China even then. We are also clear that we should build better relation with the northern neighbor. We should not allow India or America to interfere in our relation with China just like we should not allow China to covertly or overtly interfere in our relation with India or America. \\nOnly that will provide an opportunity for us to maintain close relation with all the powerful countries and reap benefits from that. Nepal will become a playground for powerful countries if Nepal supports or opposes any country for the sake of another. That will spell trouble for us in the long run.\\nThe lawmakers, therefore, should think seriously about the issue and take a decision based on their wisdom. The people have elected lawmakers prescisely to discuss and decide about such important and tricky issues. They should fulfill that responsibility handed over by the electorate.\",\n",
       " \"\\nNepali politics has suddenly become heated in the middle of the winter on the issue of when to hold parliamentary and local elections. Different positions of the parties have been made public while the Constitution and election laws are also being interpreted differently.\\nParties are currently making different interpretations of Article 225 of the Constitution and clause 3 of the Local Election Act.\\nArticle 225 states that the term of rural assembly and municipal assembly will be five years, and election for the next rural assembly and municipal assembly should be held within six months of end of that term.\\nClause 3 of the Local Election Act, on the other hand, states that members will be elected two months before the term of rural assembly and municipal assembly expires.\\nCPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal has argued that local election can be held in November-December pointing that the Constitution prevails if provision of other laws contradict the Constituion.\\nSome legal experts point that the Constitution and the election act talk about rural assembly and municipal assembly and not rural municipality and municipality.\\nElection of 753 rural and municipal assemblies can be, and have been, held on separate days depending on the choice and convenience of elected local representatives. The experts point that there would have been no dispute now if the act had mentioned that election should be held two months before the term of member of rural municipality and municipal expires. \\nNo matter how the parties interpret these provisions now, we all know that the parties were careful about two things at the time of promulgating the Constitution.\\nOne is the term of local bodies will be five years and the local bodies will not be left without leadership in lack of election due to the bitter experience of local bodies remaining without elected people's representatives for around two decades. The leaders were as careful about local bodies not remaning without leadership as they were about the House not being dissolved before completing its five-year term.\\nAnother is ruling parties should not unilaterally change election date, and basic laws like election laws, laws about splitting political parties and appointment at constitutional bodies because they are directly related to the institution and system of democracy. If there is no discussion and consensus among the parties represented in the House about such issues, that derails the system and institution itself.\\nWe had, therefore, strongly protested when KP Sharma Oli unilaterally amended the laws about splitting political parties and appointment at constitutional bodies when he was prime minister (PM) to serve his narrow interest.\\nThe ruling coalition seems to be trying to amend election laws and change election date due to similar self-interests. The ruling coalition has its own onterests in first holding the federal election in April-May and the local election in November-December.\\nThe ruling coalition cannot ally in all 753 local bodies as cadres of Nepali Congress (NC) will not allow that. CPN (Unified Socialist) and even Maoist Center will struggle to win local bodies if the parties in the coalition ally.\\nThe ruling alliance will be under huge psychological pressure if the two communist parties fare poorly in the local election. NC does not want the two parties to seem weak before the general election. If the two parties seem weaker, that will benefit CPN-UML and hurt NC's prospects in the general election.\\nThe ruling alliance may also feel that vacancy in the local bodies will benefit the coalition as UML had won at more places than other parties in the last local election.\\nSher Bahadur Deuba has been accused of keeping the local bodies without elected leadership for two decades in the past. PM Deuba should not lead the act of keeping local bodies without elected leadership even this time.\\nThere are many things that need to be reformed in the election process. Holding election of all three levels of government together will not just save the state's coffers in election expenditure but also mean that decisions about development projects, transfer and promotion of staffers and other issues need not be stopped repeatedly due to the election code of conduct that comes into effect before the election.\\nThere are many such issues that the parties represented in the parliament have to sit together and agree for electoral reform to make our democracy more polished. There will definitely be a solution if the parties sit together and agree to hold the three elections together either in April-May or November-December.\\nBut the ruling coalition should not unilaterally amend election laws or push back the election date if the parties to fail to agree on these issues. There should be local election in April-May and provincial and federal elections in November-December if there is no consensus. \\nThe government should not again invite political mayhem by deciding otherwise.\",\n",
       " '\\nIndustry Minister Gajendra Hamal has resigned 40 hours after appointment. Hamal has said he has resigned listening to his conscience after widespread criticism of the appointment. Baluwatar has tried to spin the resignation by Hamal of his own volition to save its face. The press note issued by Baluwatar mentions that Hamal has resigned on request of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba even as audio recording of Hamal requesting to broadcast/publish the issue through the media pointing that Deuba may reject his resignation has been made public.\\nOne fact has been irrefutably established despite all the efforts of damage control by Baluwatar. The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.\\nPoliticians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.\\nThe main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.\\nThe ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.\\nRana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the courts verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.\\nTwo major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable. \\nThe refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the peoples representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.\\nThe SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.\\nBut the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.\\nOpposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.\\nCondemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Ranas wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.\\nWe should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House. \\nThe current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.\\nCJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.\\nOur politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.\\nNepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?\\nThe coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJs arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy.',\n",
       " \"\\nA wrong history has been repeated when the government sent an ordinance about splitting parties to the president evading the House today.\\nThe then prime minister KP Sharma Oli had first tried the ignominious option on April 20, 2020 to engineer a split in Federal Socialist Forum Nepal (FSFN) even as his party had almost a two-third majority in the House. He eventually took the ordinance back along with that about the Constitutional Council following widespread condemnation within his own party and without, and after FSFN hastily unified with Rastriya Janata Party (RJP) to stop the split that Oli had plotted.\\nOli again brought the two ordinances eight months later on December 15, 2020 to split ruling CPN if needed after Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal allied to put him in minority and then continued appointments at constitutional bodies against the spirit of Constitution.\\nHe had brought the ordinance about splitting parties first to split FSFN and then to split his own party, and that about the Constitutional Council on both the occasions to curtail representation of opposition in constitutional bodies.\\nSher Bahadur Deuba has now given Oli a taste of his own medicine pushing CPN-UML on the verge of split. Deuba would not have even dared to bring the ordinance had Oli not done so last year. Oli would have moral grounds to oppose that even if Deuba had. Oli's acolytes who defended the ordinances last year or did not oppose them also do not have the right to oppose the ordinance brought by Deuba. \\nThose who had opposed the ordinances brought by Oli then have every right to oppose this ordinance now. And they must oppose this undemocratic step with determination. There should be no doubt that the axe Deuba has today taken to the House will not just hurt Oli but our democracy. It will ultimately undermine democracy.\\nParties are agents of democracy and democracy becomes weak if the agents become weak. Repeated disputes and splits in parties erode democracy. Frustrate the people. Inspire the anti-democratic forces and those who want to wind the clock back.\\nThe ordinance about splitting parties brought by Oli last year and Deuba now has undone the democratic reforms we started. This is unpardonable attack on democracy by both of them. There is a long background to the legal provision we now have about splitting parties. Nepali Congress (NC) nearly split during the first term of the House after restoration of democracy in 1990. There was a wave of splits in parties including UML, the then largest party in the House, during the second term. The then third largest party RPP split repeatedly. Horse trading of lawmakers and holding them hostage in hotels inside and outside the country started then. That instilled aversion toward the parliamentary system in the people.\\nThe situation worsened after the Jana Andolan II. The three Madhes-based parties elected to the First Constituent Assembly (CA) with a big mandate splintered into 18. There were over two dozen parties in the CA due to the proportional representation (PR) electoral system. Leaders of those small parties sold the PR seats to the highest bidders. \\nThere was a strong demand and intense pressure from the public, the media and even inside big political parties to stop this wrong practice. We made two corrections in the law after the Constitution was promulgated in 2015. \\nThe first is that a party must get at least three percent of PR votes, and win at least one seat in the first past the post electoral system (FPTP) to become a national party and to be eligible to get PR seats in the House. That limited the number of recognized national parties in the House to five even though it was 25 in the CA.\\nWe also made another improvement in the act about political parties. The act earlier had the provision allowing split of political parties with support of 40 percent in the central committee or the parliamentary party. That was amended to make it require support of 40 percent in both the parliamentary party and the central committee to split any political party.\\nThis stopped the practice of winning the election on ticket of a party and later splitting the party by taking a fat sum or to become minister. No party has split in the current House after the provision came into force. CPN split into CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) on order of the Supreme Court.\\nThis ordinance brought by Deuba, however, has paved the way for UML to split. He has brought the ordinance allowing split of political parties with support of 20 percent in the central committee or the parliamentary party to serve his interest.\\nOli can oopt for revenge if he again comes to power in the future and bring an ordinance allowing split of political parties with support of just 10 percent in the central committee or the parliamentary party to engineer a split in NC or another party.\\nDeuba, who has been linked with almost all the wrong political practices since restoration of democracy in 1990 if he has not initiated those practices, will not have moral right to protest then like Oli now.\",\n",
       " '\\nOnce again, the issue of caste discrimination is dominating national conversation.\\nAmid an uproar over a journalist being denied a room in rent because of her caste and the subsequent intervention by a minister to get the landlord accused of such discrimination released, ideas and proposals on how to break away with such violations of national and human rights laws have been hitting the headlines.\\nA national campaign has been urged to end discrimination against Dalits and this is surely something worth considering but we need to reflect about the details, the contents and the overall goal of such proposal.\\nShould such campaign just be focused on the stigmas faced by citizens belonging to the Dalit community or instead have an enlarged radar and bring in also an attention on other groups within the society that have also been object of a pattern of discrimination on a consistent basis?\\nThink about many marginalized indigenous groups in the country. Think about members of the citizenry discriminated and abused because of their sexual orientation. Think about members of disability community or members of Muslim community or citizens from Madhes that have been often perceived as strangers.\\nYou surely also have sections of the so-called dominating groups with grievances as well.\\nThe more you think, the more you realize that discrimination in the country has been a constituent part of the old system that in many ways is still pervasive in so many aspects of daily lives.\\nMany positive changes happened but they are not enough.\\nIt is important to recognize this reality but inevitably this also brings about the issues of the so-called perpetrators, those who are perceived and seen as holding on to the ancient discriminatory status quo.\\nThis is an extremely delicate and sensitive issue and to better understand how divisive it can turn out, I spent considerable time reading about Critical Race Theory (CRT) and all the divisions that this subject, unintentionally or, for some, intentionally, is creating in the United States of America.\\nCRT is a broad area of studies that tries to understand how racism has permeated many aspects of the life in the United States, offering to explain how the ongoing discrimination against minorities there must be read through the prism of a system that for so many years was structurally designed to favor the white majority while intentionally leaving behind all the rest.\\nAcknowledging past historical injustices, recognizing how certain groups were discriminated in the name of a very limited and selective concept of freedoms and justice, principles applicable for so long just to certain members of the society, makes sense to me.\\nYet the process must be driven toward reconciliation and centered on a will to deal with the past without indiscriminate blaming of present and future generations belonging to certain groups that are accused for past injustices.\\nThe problems start when such attempts are, intentionally or not, used to create a wedge in the society, pitting whites versus African Americans, Latinos or Asian Americans or other members of minorities like native Americans who have been historically discriminated.\\nYou read about weaponization of the concept of race as many white Americans are strongly pushing back CRT teaching because they feel that such studies are portraying all whites as inherently racist.\\nOn the other side some members of the minority groups might be instead keen to ask not for reconciliation or healing but for revenge and this is extremely dangerous.\\nA reckoning with the past has become, at least for those pushing back against it, about group identities where individuals are risked to be judged not for their personal actions and behaviors but are considered as member of a certain racial groups.\\nIn a way, for many, the entire issue has not been about reconciliation but about white oppressors versus minorities being perennially oppressed.\\nThe issue is extremely complicated and inflammable as extremes on both sides of the equation might further polarize the issue, sowing more divisions.\\nI think that this long introspection in whats happening in the USA is important for Nepal as well.\\nAs the country is extremely diverse and with many layers of discrimination still thriving in many peoples mindsets, it is essential to have a national conversation about diversity and discrimination faced by many citizens.\\nIt is about reflecting on hidden privileges and it is about realizing and admitting that a citizens status and position could have been influenced by certain norms and patterns that enabled ones privileges at the expenses of others.\\nIt is true that the Constitution and laws are now strong enough to formally punish any acts of discrimination but this is not enough. Incidents like the one experienced by citizens being denied a room or apartment, would not happen if it were.\\nThat is why we need to have a national discussion centered around the issue of discrimination and injustices with the overall intent to ensure that such reckoning does not bring further division and bitterness as is happening in the USA.\\nFor sure it is something that would make someone uncomfortable and uneasy but this would be part of a process of national healing.\\nWe should not forget that after all, the Maoist insurgency here was initiated in the name of a better and more just country for all.\\nIt is essential that all members of the traditionally dominating groups realize that the game was not fair for many other members of the society that in the past could not even imagine themselves as equal peers.\\nOnly together, in the spirit of understanding, reconciliation and healing, a new pathway can be found for the country to emerge stronger and more just.\\nDealing with the past does not necessarily mean keeping on blaming some members of the society for the ways the system was structured in the past but it certainly implies an acknowledgement of it.\\nAny divisive issues like stronger quota systems and other positive discrimination measures should be discussed in a spirit of healing certain fault lines that do exist in Nepal as well.\\nSuch mechanisms should be decided and accepted wholeheartedly by those who might lose something out of them because they can be indispensable in creating a real level playing field in the country.\\nAs emotional as such conversation might be, a certain detachment will be needed to listen to each other and better understand all the sides of the equation. Only an exercise centered on deep listening and reflective silence will do the job.\\nWe need to create a multi-stakeholder coalition to fight against all kinds of discriminations but we need to make sure that the highest number of citizens, including those from the traditionally predominant groups, fully embrace such efforts.\\nDealing with discrimination starts with understanding, and understanding leads to reflections, and reflections bring to a process of self-realization.\\nAs a consequence, consciously or unconsciously, patterns of thinking and behaving might change and if this process is properly done, the changes will not cause a pushback like in the United States but a new beginning instead.\\nNepal can come up with its own way of dealing with the past and present injustices.\\nA prosperous nation can only thrive if the grievances of many and the concerns of others are discussed and wisely dealt with.\\nIn the United States the discussions are turning more and more divisive but in Nepal it could be an entirely different story.\\n(The author is the Co-Founder of ENGAGE.The opinions expressed here are personal.)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nBrahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra. These are the four different labels that unequalize equally born humans. This article answers why and how society engraves these marks upon our identity.\\nBhardwaj, a prominent sage of the Mahabharat era asks another sage Bhrigu, \"What is it that distinguishes the Varna?\" Bhrigu opined, the Varna is a color-coded system. To this, Bhardwaj replied that, colors are seen among all Varnas; the sensation of desire, anger, fear, greed, grief, anxiety, hunger and toil prevails over all human beings; the flow of bile and blood happens in all human bodies, so how are they different? (Hiltebeitel Alf, Dharma: Its Early History In Law, Religion, And Narrative, 2011)\\nVarna is a Sanskrit word that literally translates into English as color or complexion. The Varna system is rooted in Hinduism but Dharmashastras and Upanishads are obscure about racial prejudice based on color. Different colors have been observed within the same Varna ruling out the possibility of distinction based on color. So, the same question arises time and again: What actually distinguishes Varna?\\nThe idea of Varna system has a long history and tradition dating back to Vedic times. Manusmiriti is considered one of the prominent historical texts that talks about the Varna Byabastha (i.e., system of Varna) in the Vedic era. The law of Varna teaches each one of us to earn our own bread by following the ancestral calling. Our ancestors divided themselves into different social classes which are today popularly known as Varnas or put more regressively, the re-constructed castes. Back then it defined not our rights but our duties. With the introduction of the Varna system, society was segregated into four major divisions. People who were associated with scholarly works and religious works were classified as Brahman. People who were good at administration and warfare were given the title of Kshatriya. People who were good at trade and businesses were called Vaishya. The laborers and service providers were called Shudra.\\nLord Krishna says in the twenty-seventh verse of the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita that people of earth are classified into four Varnas on the basis of their \\'Guna\\' i.e., quality. The one who is wise, moral, virtuous, and manifests principles of proper conduct is \\'Sattoguni\\', thus called Brahman. Kshatriya is \\'Rajoguni\\' characterized by higher energy, passion, desire, and pain tolerance. They have the qualities of an administrator. Vaishya has mixed quality of \\'Rajoguni\\' and \\'Tamoguni\\'. Shudra is \\'Tamoguni\\', characterized by lethargy and ignorance.\\nIt is perplexing to trace the origin of theVarna system. However, it is assumed that in the past, not everyone had the access to education and some privileged classes acquired knowledge and exerted power over the society. The four Varna system might be a new concept but the trend of class division is as old as humankind and has prevailed in almost every human civilization. In this regard, Winston Churchill correctly quotes that \"History is written by the victors and powerful people\". Long ago when the Varna system actually came into light, the then powerful people, the educated ones were involved in the paper and administrative works. By the virtue of the power they wielded, they classified people into four Varnas on the basis of the nature of their profession. Thus, the four Varnas; Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra, collectively known as Savarnas came into existence. There were other people called Avarnas who were considered unworthy to fall under any of those four classes (Chandra et.al, India\\'s Struggle For Independence 1857-1947 (1989). In the present day, some Dalits and other backward castes fall under the category of \\'Avarnas\\'; deemed untouchables.\\nSome historians are convinced that the Varna system is solely formed on the basis of the nature of work, some claim it to be a color-coded system while others relate it to the Varnakram set by Dharmashatras. Although the historicity of Varna system is ambiguous, the exclusion of Avarnas is an evidence that the discrimination was practised even before the Varna system came into existence and somehow the discriminatory mindset of the privileged class was behind the introduction of this systematic oppression. This is supported by the fact that Vaishyas and Shudras were deprived of basic education and they had to indulge in the works requiring limited basic skills. It is an utmost truth that the Varna system was introduced by those who wielded the power at that time. The famous Irish Singer, Frank Harte was once quoted to have said, \"Those in power write the history, while those who suffer write the songs.\" It is obvious that the rulers reconstructed the society in such a manner that the hierarchy set by them would always favor them and they could continue ruling over the lower class people. Put simply, the Varna system was not solely divided on the basis of the nature of work and activities. There is a popular saying that Works are not to be considered big or small, every kind of work is equal but at the same time, the reason behind different people being discriminated is the nature of their work. The entire process of assigning a hierarchical position to profession ranging from honor to humiliation is the dissatisfaction that we carry against the Varna system. We eat the crops they harvest in the utensils they make but we hesitate to dine with them. But, this is not completely our fault, we are only doing what we have been taught by our parents. This is the stance we use in our defence when we are confronted with our discriminatory behaviour.\\nIn Nepal, it was King Jaysthiti Malla who systematized the caste system by introducing four Varnas and sixty-four Jaats. After the unification of Nepal, it was Prithvi Narayan Shah who modified the caste system into four Varnas and thirty-six Jaats. Whatever the intention may have been, it has always oppressed the so-called lower caste people systematically. In the present day Nepal, Dalits are routinely denied access to religious sites; they face resistance to inter-caste marriages; non-acceptance of water touched by Dalits and the list of discriminatory practices goes on. As stated earlier, this is the outcome of classifying and discriminating the work and profession itself. Among the four, Shudras are the critical sufferer of the Varna system because the nature of their work is considered derogatory in the books of our society. We have always turned away from the fact that the same work is feeding us and keeping us in a healthy environment. It is high time we understand that every work is meritorious and equal in status, as long as it is done with honesty, morality and lawfulness.\\nThe Varna system is not something that we should pass on to the next generation as an ornamental ancestral relic. In the present, people from all Varnas are doing all kinds of work. The segregation of work no longer exists. People of Shudra community are involved in scholarly works, administrative works and trade activities because now they too have access to education. Brahmans can do business activities and are doing too. Some so-called higher caste people are working as laborer and service-provider abroad while acting as the sole child of God in our own land. This proves that the disrespect for a profession has disappeared from our conscience but the social acceptance of the fact is yet to come.\\nLet us take a moment and have a good look around us, we see our society is changing slowly and gradually. It is not as orthodoxical as it was in the past. There is healthy acculturation of the works that were previously understood hereditary privilege. The children of Brahmans are not necessarily involved in religious works; Kshatriyas are not necessarily involved in administrative works; Vaishyas are not obliged to carry on their parents business, and Shudras are not meant to serve all. The ancestral family profession has shifted from being a compulsion to optional. The choice of our profession is upon us and living in a democratic society, choice is what matters the most. No one holds the power to assign class, put alabel or compel others to any profession. We lived in the past where the nature of our work determined our class and category but today our caste should not be the determining factor in our work.\\nGoing back to history, it has always been hypocritical in matters of theVarna system. In the epic tale of Mahabharat, Bhisma forbade Karna from putting up a fight against Arjun because he belonged to a lower caste family and thus was supposed to work as a rider of a chariot as his father did. Considering Mahabharat not as mythology but as a history, it portrayed the then society where the rulers did not allow lower caste people to indulge in another profession. Society was run according to the will of people in power. Karna, being a Sut Putra (son of a chariot driver), was denied knowledge of armory by Dronacharya and was deprived of honor by Bhisma. But when King Shantanu, the father of Bhisma, fell in love with a fishermans daughter decades earlier, Bhisma was the one who lobbied for the marriage of a Kshatriya King and a fishermans daughter. Observing my society I understood that fishermen fall under the Vaishya\\'s category and Bhisma accepting Vaishya stepmother contradicts his own bias against Karna that deprived him of the respect he deserved due to his caste. This story clearly depicts the hypocrisy of the lawmakers who made the Varna system to give a new structure to the society but ultimately set the hierarchy so as to continue their rule over people below them.\\nIt is the ultimate truth of our society that casteism exists. The one who believes that there is no such thing as caste or Varna, is evidently living in denial. They are not ready to share their privileges with the so-called lower castes. To understand this thoroughly we need to visit the rural areas: My hometown is in the south-east of Jaleshwar Municipality in Mahottari District. People of different castes like Maithil Brahman, Bhumihar, Khatbe, Chamar, Kewat, etc. live there and all of them have their separate tole (colony). I was born and brought up there but it was only after my high-school, I realized my village has different colonies like Brahman Tole, Chamar Tole, Khatwe Tole, etc. A year ago when my grandfather passed away, according to the culture of tarai, we arranged feast for the villagers. When villagers arrived and the feast began, the people of all castes sat with their own caste only and avoided contact with the people of other castes. At first, it was surprising to me because I was living in ignorance as I believed that my villagers do not discriminate merely on the basis of caste but the ground reality was different and beyond my imagination.\\nThis is an example but not the only example. Recalling the Rukum incident where Navaraj BK and his friends were killed, it is prima facie evident that he was beaten to death because he belonged to the Dalit community and dared to fall in love with a girl of so-called higher caste. Our society is still filled with people who label us with a particular Varna at the moment we are born. Navaraj BK was killed because loving a girl is a sin in the eyes of our society and it is a bigger sin when the label of lower caste is engraved in our identity. It is an ignominy that a man gets killed for falling in love because he was a Dalit in the 21st century. Had he belonged to the higher caste he might have been alive today. This fact will haunt us as long as we unequalize equally born humans labelling them as Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras.\\nIn a democratic society, different people have different opinions and thus different ideologies become the factor for the evolution of different religions. I have a firm belief that religion is the product of ideology and faith. But, the Varna system or the caste system is nowhere the product of either ideology or faith even though the Varna system has its roots in the Sanatan (eternal) Hindu Dharma. The very first factor that played role in the division of Varna was the nature of work people practised and then gradually the discriminatory notions overtook the structure and it became a hereditary trait in due course of time.\\nSome people argue that discrimination is a very human thing, it has nothing to do with theVarnasystem but we cannot disagree with the fact thatVarnasystem is the product of discrimination and vice-versa. In no way discrimination is a human thing, so let\\'s try our best to erase the predetermined notions set byVarnasystem and teach ourselves and our future generations that the Varna system was a privilege given to the already privileged class and, therefore, a burden to the lower class. Some say, it was revolutionary to give the new structure to the society and some people are of the view that it was the systematization of the class division with the flavor of discrimination. While the motive behind bringing the Varna system into practice is ambiguous, the discrimination it brought with needs to stop. It should not be passed on to the next generation.\\n(The author is a law student currently pursuing BALLB from Nepal Law Campus, Kathmandu)',\n",
       " \"\\nEvents like Education Minister Krishna Gopal Shrestha dropping the landlord who allegedly refused to lease a room to Rupa Sunar due to her caste need no explanation.\\nOne can understand the society being divided about how big a mistake the landlord's refusal to lease the room on the basis of caste is, and how some have taken this as a minor incident. One can also understand how some are angry that the woman, nearly 60, was locked up for three days and others sympathize with her. One can understand all these things in a society that has been mired in caste system for centuries and also understand arguments of some that it takes time to change the society. \\nThe police had submitted the investigation file to the District Government Attorney Office which could have decided whether to take the case to the court or not if it were allowed to do its work fairly. The court could have then found the woman guilty or acquitted her. We all would and should have accepted the verdict.\\nBut the government hijacked the case that was in a judicial process. The District Government Attorney Office did not move the case forward citing lack of evidence and sent it back to the police for further investigation. Minister Shrestha went to the police station for release of the accused and dropped her home in his official vehicle fluttering the national flag.\\nIt's the words of Sunar against that of the woman in the case for now in lack of evidence and people are free to choose which side to trust. But the woman has not been acquitted by the court and the District Government Attorney Office, under pressure from the government, has only sent the file back for further investigation. And she still remains accused of the offense.\\nThe Constitution has explicitly prohibited any kind of discrimination on the basis of caste. Minister Shrestha appointed in accordance to the Constitution cannot use that position to solicit release of a person accused of an offense prohibited by the Constitution that he has sworn to while taking oath as a lawmaker and minister. He also cannot use the vehicle he got in capacity of the position as minister to drop the accused home. He also cannot flutter the national flag recognized by the Constitution to provide official endorsement for his abominable and unpardonable act.\\nIt is not hard to see why Minister Shrestha did that. The accused is a Newar woman and many naively say he stood for the Newar community. But we firmly believe that he did that for votebank politics and not for the Newar community. He would have stood for dozens of families who were rendered homeless in the name of road expansion in Balaju if he stood for the benefit of Newars. He was nowhere to be seen when the indigenous people in the Kathmandu Valley suffered from glottophobia for years. Where does he stand in the ongoing movement to conserve the culture and heritage of the Valley, and revive the Valley to its glorious ancient form? His action has once again revealed the age-old nature of opportunistic politicians to try to cash in on social disputes.\\nMinister Shrestha going to the police station in this manner is tantamount to the state, that should have stood up for the victim, standing against the victim. This is not just a question about Rupa Sunar but about caste discrimination that has dragged our society down for centuries. Many have similarly been denied rooms in the Valley. But this is still not an issue just of the Valley or a certain community. This is a representative story of the discrimination that dalits have faced for centuries. Around four million dalits across the country were looking at the issue with hope that they would for once get to experience that the equality granted by the Constitution is not merely an empty promise but actual right that can be exercised without any fear or retribution. Minister Shrestha has added insult to injury of these millions of dalits. The woman may be pardoned using myriad of arguments or acquitted by the court in lack of concrete evidence. But the crime that he has committed in capacity of the representative of the state cannot be pardoned. He deserves punishment for that. \\nWe urge the prime minister and ruling CPN-UML to either fire Minister Shrestha or formally swear allegiance to the caste system. There will be no need to make noise expecting democracy and social justice from this dispensation after that. The dalits will also have no illusion about equality or expectation about social justice, and may perhaps disabuse themselves of the rosy interpretation of the Constitution.\",\n",
       " '\\nThe G7 summit held in person at Carbis Bay in the United Kingdom past weekend made for an interesting viewing from Nepal. Leaders of the seven rich and liberal democracies of the world frolicked maskless at the beach on the Atlantic coast even as virtually whole of Nepal is under prohibitory orders. The seven leaders, the majority of whom are over 65 years old with three septuagenarians and just two below 50, mingled without face masks even indoors and pledged more doses of vaccines to the global south. Indian Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, invited as a guest country, virtually addressed the summit sounding a clarion call for following a \"one earth, one health\" approach to effectively deal with the pandemic globally. Nepalis, rubbing their eyes in disbelief, watched the Indian media rave about how Modi lectured the world leaders about their collective responsibility toward tackling the pandemic globally. Some may even have felt that the leader with recent \\'sage\\' makeover has had an epiphany and would lift the export ban of vaccines at least in the immediate neighborhood. But there was no such epiphany alas and India has yet to relax export ban at the time of writing this editorial.\\nAll that frolicking and pomp was vulgar to see from Nepal where around 1.4 million older adults are hopelessly waiting for the second dose of Covishield vaccine over three months after getting the first one. Nepal started its vaccination campaign with the one million Covishield (AstraZeneca manufactured in India) doses donated by India just a few days after it was started in India. The government did not choose to inoculate the most vulnerable older adults with the doses remaining after inoculating the frontline health workers and opted to jab journalists, government staffers and bankers among others instead. Nepal opted for inoculating older adults only after paying Serum Institute of India for two million more doses and one million of them arrived. The government, despite all its ineptitude in handling the pandemic, was cautious even after the one million doses arrived and consulted the WHO before starting to vaccinate the older adults. It started to inoculate people above 65 years from the second week of March only after consent of the WHO. With well over one million doses in hand, advance payment already made to Serum for another one million doses and assurances that it will also receive its share of vaccines from the global vaccine alliance COVAX. Nepal even agreed to inoculate foreigners working in different diplomatic missions and international organizations in Nepal ahead of the older adults with assurances that there will be no shortage of doses. This was kind of generosity not even the developed countries showed toward foreigners at that time.\\nBut as the older adults started counting down the eight weeks they were told they had to wait for the second dose, the second wave hit India hard. Serum, on instruction of the Indian government, refused to deliver the one million doses Nepal had already paid for and also to COVAX as it was obliged to. The government requested New Delhi to at least provide enough for second dose to the older adults but to no avail. Serum has to supply the doses after taking advance payment for the sake of ethical business practice. The Modi government should allow export of the doses on humanitarian grounds if not for the millennia of special bread and daughter relation with Nepal that he repeatedly invokes. The quantity, that has become a matter of life and death for Nepali older adults, is almost irrelevant for a vast country like India. It is not even half of the Covishield doses that Serum manufactures each day on an average and can be easily offset by smoothening the supply chains inside.\\nThe older adults have to hopelessly wait even as the western media report that the delta variant, first seen in India and assumed to be the dominant even in Nepal, is significantly more contagious than other variants. Studies show that while two doses of AstraZeneca provide full protection against serious disease from delta variant, single dose provides significantly less protection against the variant than against the original virus. Britain initially had gambled to extend the gap for second dose of AstraZeneca from four weeks to 10-12 weeks to ensure more people have some level of protection instead of a fewer having complete protection and others no protection at all. But considering the significant risk of delta variant even for those receiving one dose, it has brought the gap to well below eight weeks. It is now rapidly inoculating younger Britons having all but finished vaccinating most vulnerable older adults.\\nIn this grim scenario, the only option the Nepal government has for the older adults if it doesn\\'t get AstraZeneca/Covishield vaccines is to provide two doses of Chinese or another vaccine. Some studies are being done in the West about giving Pfizer vaccine as the second dose after first dose of AstraZeneca and preliminary results show that such mixing indeed works. But the results are just preliminary and it will be too late for such mixing to be officially authorized for the vulnerable Nepalis who received the first dose three months back.\\nStarting a new kind of vaccine for the older adults would mean that 1.4 million doses of Covishield given as the first dose will be wasted. That would be unpardonable considering how precious and scarce the life-saving vaccines are. Nepal and India also have another kind of special relationship apart from the clichd bread and daughter relationship Modi always invokes. Nepali men have fought for India for centuries and thousands have died protecting the Indian borders over the years. Thousands of Nepalis still serve in the Indian army. The Nepali older adults awaiting the second dose include many veterans who have served India in the past and may well be parents and grandparents of many who are currently serving the Indian forces. Not providing these doses would tantamount to wastage of all the one million doses donated by India and another 400,000 procured by Nepal.\\nIndia at least can point at the devastation wreaked by the second wave in defense of its vaccine nationalism. But the richer countries do not even have that excuse. America has tens of millions of AstraZeneca doses that it doesn\\'t intend to use. With the country securing enough doses of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson  Johnson vaccines to inoculate the American people many times over, it has finally pledged to provide AstraZeneca to other countries. But it outrageously is waiting for approval of the Food and Drug Administration before supplying them to other countries despite it already being approved in those countries. America is the first country to have diplomatic relation with Nepal apart from British India and have invested billions in foreign assistance to Nepal over the years. It is baffling that America has not provided the AstraZeneca vaccines it won\\'t use to solve the humanitarian crisis in Nepal.\\nBritain, like India, has special relationship honed over centuries with Nepal. It is troubling that Britain is not doing anything to avert the humanitarian crisis by supplying AstraZeneca vaccines developed there. Thousands of Nepalis have died fighting for the British Empire since their colonial rule in India. Selling AstraZeneca vaccines to Nepal to inoculate the older adults would be a small gratitude for the tons of Nepali blood shed for the British cause. ,\\nJapan is another example. It has ordered 120 million doses of AstraZeneca to be delivered by September that it will not use on Japanese people in all likelihood. It authorized use of AstraZeneca around three weeks back. But it has yet to start its use citing the very rare instances of blood clots and has already secured enough of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to inoculate those aged 16 or older. Japan has tremendous goodwill in Nepal despite not being an immediate neighbor or a global superpower and Nepali people consider it to be the only donor with no strategic interest in Nepal. It is regrettable that Japan sits top on the pile of AstraZeneca vaccines, many of them reportedly on verge of expiry, even as those above 65 here in Nepal are in this hopeless situation.\\nThe communist government in its exuberance to please China may have rubbed Japan the wrong way in the past few years. There have also been murmurs from Japanese diplomats about the problem Japanese business folks face in repatriation of income generated here back to Japan. But that does not mean the Japanese diplomats, who have always been selfless friends for Nepal, should remain mere spectators to the humanitarian crisis unfolding here. We urge the Japanese Embassy to take initiative to allow Nepal to buy the AstraZeneca vaccines Japan does not intend to use if donating is too much to ask for in these troubled times.\\nThe United Nations and health experts have been repeatedly pointing that no one is safe from this virus until everyone is safe but the rich countries despite paying lip service to that have been shamelessly practicing vaccine nationalism. It is criminal on part of rich countries to outbid and elbow out poorer countries with non-existent health infrastructure to secure enough vaccines to inoculate their people many times over and then allow the spare doses expire unused. It is obscene to bribe younger adults with joints and beer for vaccine when the pandemic has already waned there while even the frontline health professionals and the older adults in poorer countries in the midst of a surging pandemic cannot get the jab.\\nVaccine delayed, like justice, is vaccine denied. But better late than never. The pledge of G7 to secure a further one billion vaccine doses for other countries over the next 12 months primarily through COVAX is welcome. But more is needed and needed today, not the next year as WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus rightly says. \"There are enough doses of vaccines globally to drive down transmission and save many lives, if they are used in the right places, for the right people,\" he stressed speaking after the G7 announcement. There are more than enough doses of unused AstraZeneca vaccines on verge of expiry around the world to provide second dose to the older Nepali adults. The international community with their collective conscience buried under the piles of unused surplus vaccines owe at least that much to Nepal.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe ever-increasing trade deficit of Nepal has crossed Rs 1 trillion. Balancing the economy has always remained a challenge for the government and having trade surplus remains a distant dream. The government recently announced a controversial plan to export sand, gravel, rocks and other materials to India to balance the trade deficit. This invited heavy criticism from all quarters including the political parties, environmentalist, and the non-governmental sector among others. Though the government denies that mining will be carried out in the Chure region, there is a big ethical question on whether or not to extract resources from any specific geographical region.\\nThe vulnerability \\nMining certainly has some implications on the environment at local and regional scales. Any alterations upstream will bear upon the natural settings downstream, especially if the physiography is relatively fragile. This is the exactly the case of Chure region of Nepal which is unique in terms of its geology, geomorphology and ecology. Geologically it is the youngest mountain of the Himalayas comprising of unstable slope and unconsolidated rocks. The tarai section of the Chure is already prone to flooding and inundation. Chure Master Plan, the most comprehensive document so far for Chure management, shows that about 89,797 hectares of Chure falls under highly vulnerable category in terms of flooding and inundation. Likewise, 145,794 hectares falls in the moderately vulnerable category. With lack of management and unregulated mining, there is a risk of additional areas being pushed to the vulnerable category. These geo-hazards are further exacerbated by recent but unprecedented anthropogenic pressures like forest encroachment and degradation, uncontrolled grazing, forest fire, uncontrolled excavation of sand, gravel and boulders from rivers and streams in the Chure.\\nAmong the several activities, mining in the rivers has remained the most contested issue over the past several years. Records show that there are 242 mining sites across 27 districts of Chure region. In addition, 136 potential mining areas have been identified. The reason for this scale of expansion of the industry is perhaps the revenue that governments collect. Statistics show that the Bagmati province alone collected over Rs 1 billion in revenue from the local government, majority of which came from mining taxes. The lucrative nature of this business has not only convinced the government to allow mining, it has rather promoted illicit collection and export across the border.\\nThe illegal extraction has not only altered the topography of the Chure region including the downstream, millions of lives are in danger due mainly to their exposure to flooding events. Estimates show that 14 million inhabit the Chure region. Not limited to this, about millions of people live in the Gangetic plains, meaning any environmental modifications made in Chure will have a direct implication to far south in the Indian territories.\\nThe Chure Master Plan has explicitly highlighted the fact that the initial environmental assessments are not adequately followed and that monitoring and regulation is equally weak. It further stresses that the amount of materials drawn exceeds the actually permitted amount. Technically, the rate of excavation of such mines should not exceed that of the rate of deposition. This has particularly been happening close to expanding market areas. For instance, areas close to urban centers likeTinau of Rupandehi, and certain areas in Bara and Dhanusha districts are a few examples of soaring mining activities, some in illicit ways.\\nEnvironmental impacts\\nStudies have shown that over extractions can have an array of environmental impacts. That ranges from impacts on the aquatic ecosystem, loss of land mass due to erosion, disruption in the waterflows thus triggering water currents, damages to infrastructures including bridges, all of which undermines the protection against flooding events.\\nThe argument that extraction of gravels and boulders is reasonable as long as the sand/sediment budget and the hydraulic information is adequately considered. Indiscreetly, mining in Nepal has lacked scientific discernment compounded by the lack of capacity on part of the local bodies and administration to conduct environmental assessments and regular monitoring. Not only has this motivated over extraction of the resources, illegal collections and export across the border is rife. Dozens of illegal mining and export remains unreported across Nepal. This shows the lack of capability of the government to regulate the collection, thus in contradiction to its claim to sustainable extraction. Attack on the journalist reporting on illegal sand extraction in Abu Khaireni of Gorkha district, and murder of Prakash Mahato, an environmental activist protesting the illegal extraction in rivers of Dhanusha, on January 2020 are manifestations of the illegality in this industry.\\nThe question on sustainable mining\\nThe demand for sand and gravel is ever increasing in the Indian territory. Even the major cities and peri-urban areas on the Nepali side has witnessed rapid expansion thus giving thrust to development priorities. With ever increasing demand for development materials, regulating the supply demand chain is a big challenge. Citing rising cases of illegal and unstainable mining, parliamentary committee had instructed to ban the export and mining in the Chure region in 2010 warning that the denudation would soon turn tarai to a desert. Nevertheless, imposition, and ease in the ban largely remains in the discretion of political leadership.\\nDespite periodic bans on illegal mining from rivers, these go largely unchecked and unregulated in Nepal. Previous studies have highlighted the fact that the maps identified for mining in the initial environmental assessment reports is different from areas where extraction is actually done. More alarming is that in some cases, in defiance of the assessment reports, extractions have been carried out in areas that are flood prone and under risk of river bank erosion.\\nThe expansion of tools and technology in the domains of mining is testimony to this flourishing industry. Records show 458 crusher industries operating across 37 districts. In 2017-2018 alone, excavators and shovel loaders worth Rs 19 billion were imported to Nepal. With this extractive policy, the questions always remain about sustainable mining.\\nA transboundary issue\\nThe impacts of mining can be traced beyond borders and in some cases leaves serious repercussions. For instance, Singapore is ravenously expanding its land over the seas. It is doing this through importing sand, gravel and other materials from neighboring states. The impacts of the sand export have already manifested in various countries but most notably is the disappearance of over 20 sand islands in Indonesia alone.\\nThe point is there is never a limit to the demand over such resources. With neighboring states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in India expanding rapidly, the demand for resources keep shooting up. Over 30 districts in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh usually suffer from flooding that emerge from the Nepali territory. That means India is also not spared from the detriments of the Nepali land, most importantly the Chure. As long as the mining and export ARE not checked through policies, regulations and effective oversight, there is always a likelihood of overexploitation. This would be more effective through concerted efforts of the governments across regions. Unsustainable mining across the Chure and the impacts it has across Nepal and the Indian territory demands for a joint effort. Joint assessments, monitoring, and conservation efforts between the concerned agencies in Nepal and India would equally be important to minimize the impacts of Chure degradation.\\n(Karki is a researcher and Dr Paudel a senior researcher at Forest Action Nepal)',\n",
       " '\\nNepals mountains and rivers are often praised as heavenly assets that attract touristsforeign as well as domestic. However, Nepal as a country, which is located along the seismically active tectonic plate, lies in one of the worlds most disaster-prone territory. Given the topographical fragility of its steep terrain and young geology of Himalayas as well as ferocious rivers during monsoon, human settlements in their vicinity are exposed to recurrent disaster-hazards. Moreover, deforestation, haphazard extraction of Chure, lack of sustainable engineering on road construction, impacts of climate change, unplanned human settlements, weak channeling of budgets allocated for disaster mitigation efforts, dams, embankments and other structures built by India along the border as well as Nepals lack of diplomatic acumen to resolve this issue with India through talks, have aggravated the disaster risks.\\nIt is unsurprising that Nepal, every year, records a massive loss of lives and property worth hundreds of million rupees to various disasters during monsoon. Besides, common monsoon disasters such as landslides, mudslides, lightning, flash floods, and inundations among others destroy critical infrastructures like roads, utility poles, schools and hospitals among others, leaving human settlements in peril, in many cases even out of humanitarian assistance. According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, last year alone between April and October, monsoon disasters claimed at least 463 livesthe biggest single-year casualty since the devastating earthquake of 2015while as many as 803 persons were injured, 101 others went missing and property worth Rs 797.5 million was lost.\\nNepal has continuously devised pre-disaster preparedness and disaster management mechanisms in tandem with international partners and local agencies over the years. In current federal restructuring, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Act (2017) has made it clear that the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Authority (NDRRMA) is the apex agency under the Home Ministry to work on all natural disaster risks management cyclepreparedness, response, rescue operation, recovery, relief or mitigation effortsin coordination with local and provincial governments across the nation. Also, NDRRMA has to coordinate with the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology and the Department of Mines and Geology in terms of disaster warning systems to disseminate early alert messages to the public.\\nAccording to the rules, local levels, district disaster bodies, provincial bodies and national-level authorities are required to coordinate with each other to prepare the reports on disaster risks and mitigation efforts following the bottom-up approach. Based on a database of these annual reports, higher level authorities devise national plans at the end for disaster mitigation efforts which could be channelized throughout the three tiers of the government to tackle the disaster risks.\\nThere is, however, still a huge coordination and communication gap among intra-governmental, non-governmental and private humanitarian agencies at all levels. Further, lack of clarity on how roles and responsibilities are shared among them has added to the woes.\\nMost distressingly, the efficacy of our disaster risks mitigation mechanism is questionable when it comes to enhancing disaster resilience capabilities of the hazard-prone communities. When a community is faced with calamities like landslides, floods and inundation, there are always the most pressing concerns about potential loss of lives, economic impacts and untoward psycho-social repercussions. However, in terms of most monsoon disasters, landslides in the vicinity of weak hills and high hills as well as floods on the river bank settlements are always predictable in many cases. Such hazard effects can be remarkably prevented or mitigated with coordinated community mobilization. But we have largely failed to strengthen the abilities of communities to take meaningful, deliberate and collective actions both to prevent disasters and reduce the disaster impacts. We should understand the fact that if communities are resilient, they can come forward with strong civic leadership, coordinate with each other to engage in prevention efforts as well as generate organizational linkages to withstand disaster impacts such as social, cultural, economic including psycho-social support during the crisis.\\nThis is mainly due to the fact that our disaster preparedness efforts are only focused on response soon after catastrophes befall. Throughout the year, all authorities remain almost non-functional and resort to dirty blame games when disasters wreak havoc on human societies. Even in the wake of disaster, they lack coordinated actions to extend the humanitarian services to the victims and relocate them to safer places. What happened to Sindhupalchok and Baglung landslides victims last year is just the tip of the iceberg. Had the authorities responded on time, such a huge loss of lives and property as well as psychological impacts could have been significantly averted.\\nFurthermore, owing to the unscientific human settlement patterns and inflexible land use policy in the nation as well as inaction on the part of government agencies to respond with long-term relocation plans, communities are compelled to hastily reconstruct poor shelters on the same lines where disasters normally hit year by year. This only spares hazard-prone communities to witness another years catastrophes.\\nWith this years monsoon around the corner and increased vulnerability of disaster-prone communities due to the pandemic crisis, it is utterly necessary to learn lessons from the past experiences and adopt the most possible pragmatic approaches to reduce the disaster risks.\\nIt is clear that the hilly districts sitting in the Siwalik, Mahabharat range, Mid-land as well as higher Himalayas are more vulnerable to landslides owing to their steep topography and fragile ecosystem while communities within the basin of snow-fed perennial rivers such as Koshi, Narayani, Karnali, and Mahakali among other southern rivers are always at higher risks of floods and inundation.\\nDisaster preparedness remains an urgency to mitigate the plight of people in disaster-prone communities in hills and low-lands where natural disasters are invariably recurrent phenomenon with incessant rainfall in monsoon causing flash floods and landslides. Timely communication, coordinated efforts and dedicated actions among all levels of government agencies, humanitarian agencies, national security apparatus, private partners and communities are fundamental to strengthening life-saving approaches both before and after the catastrophes befall.\\nMoreover, this is also the prime responsibility of media to educate communities to enhance their disaster resilience capabilities and keep them alert on possible disaster threats.\\nEqually important is communities awareness to be prepared with disaster supply kit contents that include essential items such as stock of food that requires no cooking or refrigeration, safe drinking water, clothing, and first aid tools as well as necessary medication to sustain a family at least for a few days. This will help ease the disaster challenges that are often faced by vulnerable populations such as children and older adults including women, patients and differently-abled individuals. As each life is precious, it is never good to be unprepared for the worst that this years monsoon may impose on us.\\n(The author is currently an MPhil scholar at Nepal Open University)',\n",
       " \"\\nThe world is currently experiencing the threat of COVID-19, which has affected 220 countries and territories. Being a Himalayan country with complex landscapes, lax quarantine systems, under-resourced health care and public health systems, less capacitated diagnostic facilities, and a long open border with India, Nepal is on the brink of health care failure and severe risk from COVID-19 pandemic. The risk has already been evinced by severe outbreaks of COVID-19 in Nepal that ranks 18th in active cases, 41st in total cases, and 51st in total deaths (as of May 31). However, the data is supposed to be underestimated due to limited testing, and lack of case tracing are common in Nepal. \\nSome measures were adopted initially to prevent the COVID-19 outbreaks, such as nationwide lockdown, closure of academic institutions and all entertainment and sports avenues, implementing travel restrictions from affected countries and borders. However, all of those measures were poorly implemented; Nepal experienced growing cases of COVID-19 despite being controlled. Reviewing the global scenario shows the COVID-19 outbreaks have been linked to the countrys public health, economic, political, and social systems. Thus, these systems should be understood to determine the appropriate preventive and therapeutic strategies of the pandemics.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of the country's health system, inequalities, and poor governance. The second wave likely driven by B.1.617.2 variant, that is reported to be highly contagious, aggressive, and fatal, has led to mass fear on the Nepali people. As of April 30, 2021, all of the as intensive care unit (ICU) wards in all of the private and public hospitals were already occupied with serious cases of COVID-19. It is a pity to see that healthcare workers provide their best services to COVID-19 patients despite being infected themselves. Many city hospitals have already run out of the necessities such as ICU beds, ventilators, oxygen, and drugs used in COVID-19 treatment. Hospitals close to Indian border have experienced massive cases of COVID-19, and this harbingers the worst situation in future if further integrated activities are not performed soon. This has been aggravated by flocking of a large number of people from India into Nepal through the porous borders, and the government not being able to control such movements. This has raised a serious threat to the introduction of new viral strains into Nepal. There is no hope of health facilities including PCR tests and others for the rural and disadvantaged people, especially in the high altitude areas with difficult landscapes. These are the underlying causes why COVID-19 patients are not traveling to the hospitals and thus are hidden from the government statistics. One can argue that overwhelming hospital attendance, strained and exorbitant health system, health services fatigue, and the resource constraints predict an even worse situation in the coming days.\\nWho is to blame?\\nThe main question regarding the second wave is who was to blame. Health workers and public health experts had already warned the government of the possible tsunami of the COVID-19 due to new viral variants. They urged the government to ramp up efforts to upgrade hospitals, arrange ICU beds, and get vaccines. Although COVID-19 Crisis Management Center (CCMC) frequently advised the government to take precautions, plans, programs, and policies related to the future outbreak, the government turned its blind eye to engage experts and use data and science and follow the public health advice. On January 28, 2021, when no death was reported for the first time after the start of first wave, health care authorities and government believed the COVID-19 epidemic was under control, were complacent, and did not prepare for possible future outbreaks. Thus, the government did not carry out border lockdown for Nepali workers and people celebrating religious/cultural events returning from India or Indian people who flew from Kathmandu to other countries by air. From the first COVID-19 wave, the government was busy concentrating on other political affairs such as infighting in the ruling party, dissolution of parliament, demonstration of power via rally, restructuring Cabinet at the central level, toppling the governments at the provincial level, and lobbying to pass the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact. The opposition parties also did not care about the pandemic as thousands of their cadres also participated in rallies and programs. While the government prohibited gathering of more than 25 people, the prime minister himself attended many public events for inauguration, political speech, and religious ceremonies, surrounded by hundreds of mostly unmasked people. In addition, politicization, false information, rumors, claims, and advocacy in social media fuelled the non-compliance, conspiracy theorists urged the general people to not follow the preventive and control measures against COVID-19. For example, PM KP Sharma Oli's hearsay regarding guava leaf therapy, turmeric powder therapy, spicy therapy, and the so-called theory of naturally immune Nepalis do not have any scientific pieces of evidence. It was highly criticized by politicians and non-aligned scientists. However, he blamed Nepali people for their negligence when the second wave hit, and then, he touted his government, claiming everything is under control, indicating his hunger for self-ennoblement. In the meantime, there are reports of corruption in the purchase of essential medical supplies and vaccines against COVID-19. This has resulted in the growing anxiety and frustration among citizens regarding the governments healthcare and economic response to the pandemic. Therefore, the PM seems to defend his government, hiding its moral failure, apathy, incompetence, and corruption regarding COVID-19 control.\\nNevertheless, it was a welcome move of the government to make a plan to inoculate all of its citizens by the end of April 2021 beginning the vaccination campaign in January. As of March 15, 2021, 1.6 million people or less than 6 % of the eligible population had received single dose of vaccine while more than a million older adults have not got their second dose of Covishield well over two months after receiving the first. It was interesting that when PM Oli was machinating to dissolve the House, the US Senate Foreign relations Committee discussed about vaccine shortage in Nepal. The recent announcement of Chinese President Xi Jinping to provide a million doses of vaccines to Nepal indicates a critical worry advocated about Nepal by the emerging leaders around the globe. \\nRecommendations \\nWhile the second wave is engulfing the country, Nepal should fight with it based on scientific evidence and medical experiences. First, it should learn a lesson from the experiences of countries like New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel, and others on how to effectively apply control and preventive measures and promote equitable vaccine distribution. Policy, which prioritized economy rather than public health in few countries like USA, India, Brazil, and others, led to the failure. Therefore, efficient and wise leadership in the current situation in Nepal is mandatory. Second, considering its capacity, Nepal should focus and invest more in the early detection, identification, and containment of viruses at the community level in all seven provinces. For this, the central government should mobilize the microbiologists, biotechnologists, zoologists and health workers via a fast-track employment system and work with health centers at the local level. Third, the government should welcome and facilitate travel permits for those individuals, groups, charities, or organizations who want to support COVID-19 patients as well as other patients. Thousands of Nepali people are volunteering delivery of the patients to the hospitals and providing primary care or quarantine centers, oxygen cylinders, antibiotics, and drugs. For this, Nepali people around the world are also playing essential roles. Fourth, a healthy collaboration of the government with different line ministries, different political parties, and prompt application of the advice given by the CCMC is essential. Awareness programs regarding vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 management via proper use of media are critical and can be conducted by following the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Fifth, the government should have aggressive contact tracing, epidemiological and molecular studies to better understand circulating variants and their epidemiological features and to implement effective control measures.\\nNepal should also talk to authorities in India about the establishment of temporary isolation centers and the closure of border entry. Sixth, in vitro as well as in vivo research using natural products, drugs, and vaccines related to the treatment and preventive strategies of COVID-19 should be conducted. Seventh, the government should implement mass vaccination as well as non-pharmaceutical interventions such as universal masking and social distancing, which have been proven successful in controlling the viral spread. It would also be better to provide alternative approaches such as deferring the second dose to accelerate and maximize vaccination coverage to the susceptible population, as practiced first in Britain. Eighth, a 'vaccine passport' or 'e-vaccination certificate' should be regulated at least at the international airport so that only the fully vaccinated individuals are allowed to enter the country. Finally, Nepal, whose current health expenditure per capita is only US$ 45.5 needs the international community including the WHO to help her combat the pandemic. How successfully Nepal defeats COVID-19 depends on the responsible leadership and public health interventions by the government.\\n(Dr Acharya is Veterinary Officer at the Animal Quarantine Office and Dr Ghimire Assistant Professor at the Department of Zoology, Tri-Chandra Multiple Campus)\",\n",
       " '\\nHarvard professor Steven Pinker, in a scholarly deliberation, subtly describes the reasons behind political rhetoric tending to be vague, empty and bland. For this, not only the politicians but also the audiences play their part equally as both are hypocritical in political messaging. It is because, he says, there is firestorm when the leaders speak substantive. In our context we can imply that a leader would not be able to draw attention of voters or people or win their support if s/he speaks reality in terms of what actually s/he can perform or is performing. To fill this void s/he speaks tall promises, vague and empty ideas that look like real with a lot of glitter to generate wow from the audience. The media, instead of focusing on substantive information, always yearns for spotting gaffes the politicians commit when there is not horse race, Pinker further observes. Framing and spin-doctoring techniques are widely applied in generating and spreading unsavory ideas as part of the political rhetoric, he argues.\\nRhetorical tricks\\nIf we minutely go through Prime Minister KP Sharma Olis political steps and subsequent communicative actions, it would be pellucid how rhetorical tricks have entirely corroborated the actions taken to secure his stay in power and capture all state machinery including constitutional bodies. Knowingly or unknowingly the media and the audience have been the prey of incessant logical fallacies from Oli and his entourage. Unless we realize this communication perspectives of todays polity, which is truly represented by PM Oli and his cortege among others, our efforts to cope any undemocratic move would be unavailing.\\nNepals republic system has so far witnessed eight PMs and two presidents. History would judge their distinctive traits and performances. All chief executives shared some short of common traits as to compromising democratic values and delivering below par, although to a varying degree. Oli, however, has painted a discrete picture, though not pleasant. When assuming the top office three years ago, Olis aura as the premier of almost two-third majority and as a chair of historically the biggest communist party of the country was astounding. In the beginning, the design of development and prosperity he mapped out were worth drawing attention to for every single Nepali who was either working as a blue-helmet worker in a gulf country or suffering from multiple problems ranging from unemployment to social injustices here at home.\\nInitially, many compelling ideas and slogans Oli articulated one after another kept on beating the media headlines. He orchestrated different strategies to establish what he had done was right and up to the mark. Later on after people began to seek true delivery from his administration rather than lofty promises, he gradually either ignored or diluted his failed attempts by attributing to other factors such as opponents in his party or foreign elements. While he busied himself to meet foreign agents, enhance his propaganda drives and take steps accordingly, he, side by side, accused his opponents of using these weapons against him. If we look at the shreds of political moves taken by Oli we can find a spiral of attempts he made to justify his every other step. As part of his attempts to create his self-respect and urgency in the power, he opted for two weapons. First was the announcement or initiation or inauguration of developmental projects, almost all of which were devoid of substantiated foundation or progress or far behind from completion. Second was the rhetorical tricks he and his team used to justify his every move through various types of logical fallacies. Essentially, this article focuses on the communication traits he and the Presidents Office made to justify the dissolution of the parliament and announcement of the elections on November 12 and 19.\\nEither me or nobody attitude \\nOli uses a lot of emotional appeals with selected phrases and imageries that can evoke a sense of urgency or compulsion in his action. Other contemporary leaders look diminutive to Oli in utilizing humor and wits. Side by side, he, at times, uses threats eliciting a sense of fear that the country and democracy will fail if his path was not adopted. How can going for the fresh mandate when no one is being able to garner required support to form a new government be autocratic move? Apparently, this question he put forth looks plausible for general audience. However, there are numerous counter questions that invalidate his idea: Is going to election by violating the letter and spirit of the Constitution appropriate? Can elections be held in free and fair manner when he has managed to take state organs including the constitutional bodies into his grip? Is it the right time to go for elections when the entire country is unprecedentedly suffering from a pandemic (COVID-19) when the parliament still has nearly two more years to complete its tenure? Instead of addressing these questions rightly, he and his team members are now busy to dilute them with ersatz ideas and partial or misrepresented truths.\\nFollowing the House dissolution, Oli, in a press meet, said that he opted for the dissolution, for the opposition alliance could neither form the government nor did it support him by giving him vote of trust in the parliament. He also tried to justify his move saying that he wanted to clear the way to form a new government under Article 76(5). His arguments do not carry any merit as they contradict on what he did in real action. Not only did he claim for new government under his leadership under the same Article for which he had cleared the way for new government, he also created a pseudo situation that led him to dissolve the parliament and go for elections. Oli, for this, adopted two tactics: presenting claims to the president that he has the support of required number of parliament members and creating a pseudo situation where the president could invalidate the claims of both the candidatesOli himself and leader of the opposition alliance Sher Bahadur Deuba. Instead of clearing the way for the new government, these tactics cleared the way for himself to invoke the Article 76(7) for dissolving the parliament and go for mid-term pollshis ultimate goal to cling on to power and vanquish his opponents.\\nPresident Bidya Devi Bhandaris logic that some of the lawmakers support to both the candidates made her invalidate both the candidates clearly appeared to be shallow and unfounded. Essentially, Deuba had appeared with signatures of more than the required numbers of lawmakers whereas Oli had just made the claim that he has the support from more than the required members by ignoring the fact that a significant number of the lawmakers from his own party CPN-UML and Janata Samajbadi Party had already revolted from their respective parties and supported Deuba. As the protector of the Constitution, Bhandari was supposed to verify the signatures by taking some time to clear her doubts so that the House of Representatives could be saved. Instead of bothering to fulfil this duty by taking some time, she dissolved the parliament and announced the fresh polls on Olis recommendation. It is obvious that she just served Olis interest by trampling all merits and reasoning against the move.\\nBR Ambedkar, after Indias Constitution was drafted under his leadership, said, . . . however good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot. Nepal is now going through a situation when the current lot (bad lot) in the power is solely responsible for the ongoing political turmoil and focus on politicking rather than devastating pandemic.\\nFighting evil spirits\\nOli will be remembered as a chicanery chief executive of democratic federal republic Nepal as he managed to use tricks and deceits in justifying his actions and create a false reality. Some of such traits comprised spending a lot of time, mostly in his almost solo deliberations, with preferably the media and journalists lenient to him; tactfully framing phrases that apparently show his actions taken either out of compulsion or urgent need of time; attacking opponents with abhorring, stinging, sardonic and belittling comments and analogies; parroting political rhetoric such as nationalism, national interest, democracy, transformation, corruption-free society in speeches but acting against them in actuality. The political parties need to revamp their internal system and nourish democratic exercise so that wrong people would not prevail to not let the history repeat itself. Emboldening public opinion against any such pernicious character from the politics is equally important. This demands efforts, either concerted at organizational level or at individual level; from the media, civil society members, research organizations and academics.\\nFighting the evil spirits is no doubt tough as they are well-equipped with resources and their dogmatic supporters or cyber troops through which they attack the opponents and whistleblowers or dilute the facts against their interest. However, it is not impossible as we all citizens can ventilate our voice through various communication channels. Since we dont have to wait for or rely on others to make our voices heard as we are readily accessible to various communication channels with enormous intensity of diffusion, we can hone these weapons, wield them against the wrongdoers and attack them by spreading facts, exposing their self-serving tricks, creating debates over the merits and demerits of public affairs and carrying out valid researches from academic and other sectors. As Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc. once said its really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time. We are living in the time of highly sophisticated communication and technology through which we can work a lot to demolish any despot. So, lets beware of glittering claims, cunningly framed speeches or stories and doctored information. Lets not forget that the time is ours!',\n",
       " \"\\nPrime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli has again attacked the Constitution and democracy after his first blow on December 20, 2020 failed. The motive is clearto shred the Constitution into pieces and derail democracy.\\nHe has full support of President Bidya Devi Bhandari in this motive. Not merely support, both of them are together in this motive. President Bhandari, therefore, threw away the written application submitted by 149 House of Representatives (HoR) members to form an alternative government as per the constitutional provision on Friday, and dissolved the HoR on recommendation of Oli.\\nThe flimsy arguments President Bhandari used to usurp the constitutional rights of 149 lawmakers makes her motive clear. Issuing a statement in the midnight, she claimed that their claims were unjustified taking help of the false claims made by Oli. Oli had sent a letter to the President less than 24 hours earlier saying he has paved the way for formation of new government pointing he does not have confidence of the House.\\nShe issued the notice saying claims of both Oli and Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba are unjustified pointing at the false claims of Oli that he now has majority. She reasoned that the supporting lawmakers are repeated on both sides, they have supported candidate of another party against the party's decision, and the parties concerned have written to not recognize their signatures.\\nThese arguments are false and baseless. First and foremost, President Bhandari's claim that the names of supporters are repeated is a blatant lie. None of the 149 lawmakers who signed to make Deuba the new PM have signed in favor of Oli. Oli rather had submitted a false letter lying that he has full support of all 121 CPN-UML lawmakers and 32 Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) ones. Thirty-eight out of those 153 had signed in support of Deuba.\\nSo much so that Oli implied that UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal and JSP leaders Upendra Yadav and Baburam Bhattarai, who were present in person while submitting the application supporting Deuba to President Bhandari, supported him.\\nAny lawmaker can sign supporting any other lawmaker who wishes to become PM under Article 76(5) of the Constitution. This provision has been kept in Article 76(5) of the Constitution precisely to ensure that any lawmaker who can muster support of majority lawmakers can form the government after the majority government, coalition government of two or more than two parties, and minority government of the largest party in the House all fail. If party whip were to be binding, there would be no meaning of keeping Article 76(5) of the Constitution.\\nThe logic that President Bhandari gave pointing that Deuba could not be appointed PM as lawmakers have supported candidate of another party against the parties' decision, and the parties concerned wrote requesting her to not recognize those signatures, therefore, is groundless.\\nLet us assume for a while that a lawmaker cannot support lawmaker of another party or an independent candidate without decision of the party concerned even under Article 76(5) of the Constitution, and the party whip is valid and the Act related to political parties is attracted.\\nA lawmaker can defy the party whip not just in the context of Article 76(5) of the Constitution, but in election under any other article of the Constitution, or any other issue. That is counted as a valid vote in the House. That vote is not annulled. A lawmaker always has that right as a sovereign representative elected by the people.\\nThe lawmaker definitely can be punished for defying the party whip, and can even lose the post of lawmaker as per the Act related to political parties. But there is no provision in the Constitution or any law in Nepal that stops a lawmaker from voting defying the party whip, or annuls the vote so cast.\\nEven if the lawmaker who signed in support of the lawmaker to be appointed PM under Article 76(5) of the Constitution were later to be punished in accordance to the law, our Constitution or law of the land does not grant any right to the President to reject the vote cast when the person is legally a lawmaker.\\nShe could have verified authenticity of the signatures if she had any doubt. She could have even summoned those lawmakers to march at the President's Office within 24 hours and asked them to sign in person to establish whether the majority of lawmakers supported Oli or Deuba.\\nBut she did not want to do that because that would have exposed Oli's lies. That step would have been against the motive she shared with him.\\nThe whimsical attitude of Oli would have largely been reined in if President Bhandari had followed the system right from the beginning and complied with the Constitution. She continued to further nurture his growing whimsical attitude instead. She is, therefore, one of the main reasons behind the the current whimsical nature of Oli and his habit of taking arbitrary decisions on whims.\\nWe should also not forget there is a very strong external dimension to the path against the Constitution and democracy that Oli has taken. It will metastasize further the more we delay to understand and publicly challenge that. Many had suspected right from the beginning that the outside hand was in play in dissolution of the HoR even on December 20. The maneuverings of the external powers have come to the fore after the House was reinstated.\\nThey are openly operating to keep Oli in power in recent times. They first advised the main opposition NC to not form an alliance against Oli and later resorted to threatening language. They did everything to woo, threaten and split JSP lawmakers to support Oli. Why are they doing all this for Oli? \\nChief of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) of India Samant Goel had arrived on an Indian Air Force plane while Nepal was in lockdown seven months back. He had a meeting with PM Oli at Baluwatar in the midnight without any representative of the Foreign Ministry. Records of even telephonic conversations of the US President with a foreign head of the state or government are kept. The records of the in-person meetings of US President with any foreigner are also kept. But there is no such record of the talk between Oli and Goel.\\nThe Indian stance toward Oli suddenly changed after that midnight meeting. Oli unconstitutionally dissolved the House on December 20 without any reason just two months later. What if the conspiratorial attack on the House and Constitution Friday midnight was a result of that Oli-Goel meeting?\\nThe way the Indians are working in recent times to stop formation of an alternative government and dissolve the House gives credence to such suspicions. This has also led to another suspicion. What is the Indian roadmap? How can one believe that the election will be held in November?\\nThe country is reeling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands are testing positive every day while the daily death toll has hovered over 150 on average for more than a week. No one can say when the pandemic will wane. Some experts fear that we may be swamped by the third wave even before the second wave recedes. It is difficult to believe that an election can be held amidst such raging pandemic. There are not even grounds to believe that Oli intends to hold election. The Constitution will be in doldrums if the election cannot be held.\\nIt's well-established that India does not like this Constitution or the House that amended the Constitution to incorporate the new map including the Nepali territories encroached by India. The strong CPN that it abhorred has been shattered due to division of CPN. Are these the objectives of India or is there more?\\nThe history of many countries testifies that democracy and Constitution and democracy of small neighboring countries do not have any meaning in comparison to the ego and interest of big countries. There have been precedents that even existence of some small countries have not mattered before the interest and ego of these big countries. \\nTherefore, we must also be aware and vigilant about this external dimension while preparing to fight this arbitrary action of Oli. But there is no need to be frightened.\\nOur own history testifies that no despot or the external powers can do anything if all the citizens come together. This is the one lesson we should take from the Janaandolan II.\\nThe struggle against the Oli's blatant attack on democracy and Constitution will be long and difficult. But it is the people who will ultimately prevail. The people have emerged victorious in every movement in Nepal right from 1951. The relevance of certain individuals for external powers is transient and they are ruthlessly disowned when their relevance ends. The external powers cannot continuously back an individual pushing the people aside for long even if they were to wish so. \\nThe first battle in the struggle against Oli's attack against democracy and Constitution is the legal fight. The 149 lawmakers whose constitutional right to elect the new PM was denied should immediately move the court.\\nThis case is less complicated that the ones lodged after the first dissolution. The Supreme Court in its verdict while reinstating the House then has explained the process through which the Article 76(7) can be exercised to dissolve the House establishing the rights of the lawmakers to provide an alternative government through Article 76(5) of the Constitution. The majority lawmakers should go to the court demanding that very right President Bhandari has usurped.\\nThe battle to bring the Constitution and democracy on track should start from there. The rest should be gradually waged after that.\",\n",
       " '\\nThe deep political division in the recently formed Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP), which claims to represent the ethnic minorities across the hills and plains of Nepal, seems to have befuddled the political crystal gazers of Kathmandu.\\nThe Mahantha Thakur-Rajendra Mahato faction of the JSP threw its weight behind Prime Minister (PM) KP Oli in a recent vote of confidence in the parliament, neutralizing the possibility of forming an alternative government by opposition parties.\\nThakur, despite his penchant for nepotism, is a respected political figure and claims to represent the Madhesis who feel excluded by the exclusionary nature of Nepali nationalism based on hill ethos. Oli, on the other hand, is at another extreme of the political spectrum who is perceived to have thrived on the same nationalist rhetoric.\\nThe Thakur-Mahato faction has defended the move by claiming that the withdrawal of cases against those implicated in the Madhesh violence during the political transition is a proof that Oli has addressed the demands of the Madhesis at least partially, and that he cannot stab Oli on the back by joining an alternative government.\\nBut declining to take charge of some lucrative ministries in Kathmandu is something that hardly makes sense for ethnic parties that tend to be highly dependent on clientelistic politics for political survival. Now the question is: does the Thakur-Mahato faction have an alternative vision for its political survival?\\nThe second puzzle is the low profile of an otherwise hyperactive Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi even as Nepal seems to have headed for an uncharted political territory  something that Beijing could have perceived as concerning for its security policy on the periphery in the changed geopolitical context. This is also in stark contrast to the previous wave of pandemic when she had raised hope of an adequate flow of Chinese medical aid to Nepal if required. The second wave of pandemic is now sweeping across the country, hospitals are running out of basic medical supplies, grieving families are mourning loved ones laid on funeral pyres, and social media walls are full of obituaries. Yet, ambassador Yanqi is no longer seen holding meetings with Nepali politicians in their residence in Kathmandu depriving the Nepali media of speculative stories about potential Chinese plot to replace India in Nepal that often send chills down the spine of Babus in New Delhi and invite knee-jerk responses from the Indian media to the delight of Twitterati in Kathmandu.\\nNor is Nepal clearly seeking help from China for medical supplies despite Olis presence on CNN to draw the US attention to the unfolding crisis in Nepal and his subsequent article in The Guardian appealing to the UK government for immediate help. China is perhaps in the best position to help Nepal at this moment, though both countries are our important partners and the US has, in particular, significantly helped Nepal. Yet, Oli made no such appeal to China which may have otherwise been obliged to respond to this crisis more effectively. Our prime ministers open letter for help to a country that is seven seas apart, despite our historic ties, while ignoring the next-door neighbor must have baffled the Chinese who are increasingly embroiled in a major power rivalry and disputes over the initial handling of the pandemic. Equally baffling and shameful was a letter sent by Nepal to India a few weeks ago, seeking medical help such as oxygen supplies when India itself was reeling under acute oxygen shortage.\\nWhat do these two puzzles have in common, anyway? Putting these two pieces of puzzles together may provide a better picture of the big puzzle that is the Oli regime and may explain several other Oli moves that are puzzling even for those who have long been observing Nepali politics and society closely.\\nOli seems to have taken a new political turn from at least the time of Nepal visit by Samant Goel, chief of Indias intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) last year, as reported by several media outlets. Interestingly, Oli has maintained total silence on the disputed issues between Nepal and India since their meeting and the new so-called pointed map of Nepal has vanished from the official discourse. It appears that Olis rapport with the Indian PM Narendra Modi was facilitated by the network of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a militant wing of Indias ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), leading to his transformation from a violent Leninist to a disciple of lord Shiva who defies the basic logic of science during pandemic. There are indications that he hopes to rule Nepal through a dominant party built along the image of BJP.\\nLeaders from the former Rashtriya Janata Party (RJP)such as the Hindu high caste leaders of the JSP like Thakur, and other like Mahatolook eager to embrace Oli as coalition partners in the new game of Hindu politics. It is worth recalling that the RJP had shown a dubious commitment toward secularism before it merged with its former rival in the plains, Federal Socialist Party, Nepal. In fact, Madhesi parties are already in trouble and are looking for ways to make a comeback.\\nWithout full political support from JSP to an alternative government, Oli however seems confident that the country would head for fresh elections. Not surprisingly, another ardent supporter of fresh elections is Kamal Thapa who wants to revert Nepal to a Hindu kingdom. With these potential coalitional parties, Oli hopes to sweep elections in the Madhesh while maintaining his support in the hills that have long remained a bastion for communist politics.\\nThis should explain why the Indian sadhus furiously attacked Oli when he first declared that Ram was born in Thori of Nepal, but have remained silent over the dispute in recent times. The only plausible explanation is the ideological evolution of Oli from Marxist-Leninist stalwart to Hindu nationalist.\\nNot surprisingly, Oli seems to be in a hurry to inaugurate half-built concrete structures or the structures that will perhaps never be built. His government inaugurated 165 strategic roads without conducting environmental impact assessments and detailed project reports, and 306 hospitals that have been inaugurated but mostly forgotten since then. Much louder is his inauguration of yet-to-be-completed Dharahara that lit up the night sky amidst a deadly pandemic. After all, Hindutva and development are two pillars of Modi politics that Oli seeks to emulate in Nepal. And, after his rapport with India, Oli is following Indias China policy in Nepal, too  that is keeping China out if its security perimeter, the Himalayas.\\nThe RSS imagines Nepal a part of the Akhanda Bharat (indivisible India) and have traditionally drawn inspiration for politics of Hindu state in India from Nepal. The Modi regime feels more vulnerable to the growing influence of the post-pandemic China in its periphery. But, as the second wave has totally paralyzed India, Oli could be a useful person to minimize the potentially growing Chinese influence in Nepal.\\nWith the help from India, KP Oli also seems to have snatched away the agenda of Hindu politics from former king Gyanendra and is using to shore up support for himself. But political strategies, however sound they may look, often fail. After all, the Hindu king himself was dethroned in Nepal, though one may argue that the context has significantly changed now. In contrast to what happened in India, Nepalis do not have any enduring collective memory of foreign invasion or occupation. Nor do we have the trauma of massive religious violence or partition of the country. But, religious violence could be a convenient way to mobilize the majority especially in the run up to elections, as evidence from India shows. Hindutva politics may fail in Nepal and may even prove to be a joke, but that doesnt mean that it will not push the country toward religious violence and authoritarianism. But the immediate concern is that the geopolitical game seems to have paralyzed us from taking help from all other countries including China.',\n",
       " \"\\nThe Maoist insurgency for many women was one of the most horrifying nightmares and continues to be the one. They had to face gross human rights violation such as sexual violence and rape. Conflict Report, 2012 states that more than one third of these victims were below 15 at the time of crime. Such bitter experiences of women continues to affect different aspects of their lives today.\\nFor some women, the incidents of them being sexually abused and raped were known to others too because they were raped in front of their children, husband, and other members of family or friends. Some of these women now face further violence and denial from their families and social stigma from their communities. For some, their husbands have asked them to leave saying they no longer are suitable to be their wife. Such discriminatory behaviors from family and community scare many other women to talk about sexual violence committed during the conflict. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2016 recorded 316 complaints related to sexual assaults, the least number of complaints among all categories. However, many reports such as Conflict Report, 2012 by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Thematic Report by TRIAL International, 2020 claim the number to be much higher because such cases remain much under-reported.\\nTribunal Report, 2018 by WOREC states that in lack of state mechanism, the female survivors of conflict continue to live with trauma. The case studies collected by WOREC and reviewed for writing this article show that being sexually abused during the conflict has resulted in deterioration of the mental and reproductive health conditions for women. At present, they experience severe mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, insomnia, loss of appetite, and pessimism about living itself, leading to suicidal thoughts. On the part of their reproductive health, many of them have developed reproductive health issues such as multiple miscarriages, uterine prolapse, infection, wounds in the uterus and uterine cancer. Nepal lacks proper mental and reproductive health services at the local level, making treatment inaccessible even in such life-threatening health situations.\\nThe faulty policy provisions and inadequate livelihood-related programs, lack of accessible health services, and patriarchal social norms have mainly created hindrances on these women's way to transitional justice in Nepal. We neither have adequate laws nor are those justice providing mechanisms serious. The TRC Act 2014 provides the possibility of amnesty even in the cases of grave human rights violations, including sexual abuse and rape. Due to fear of social stigma and the possibility of familial disowning, many women have not yet spoken up about being sexually abused during the war, which means significantly fewer cases of such incidents is included in national data. Because of this, the survivors of sexual violence couldn't access any of the state's relief support though conflict affected them severely. Similarly, we do not have mental health and adequate reproductive health services at the local level.\\nTo resolve the issues of survivors of sexual violence committed during the conflict, the government should focus on developing a unique mechanism in registering and investigating cases. There should be a justice mechanism that guarantees the privacy and protection of those who file the complaint. Survivors of sexual violence cannot present proofs, nor can they identify their perpetrators in most cases. Therefore, their statement should suffice to register the case and start an investigation, and the process should be handled by trained service providers, including female staffers. The provision of amnesty should be removed from the TRC Act. It is also the state's responsibility to design economic support programs and vocational training to support their livelihood. A well-resourced health institution at each ward and the facility of a counselor for mental well-being are required. The cases that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission have registered should be taken immediately into a fair and unbiased investigation for providing justice to the survivors and punishment to the perpetrators. Further violence and stigma against survivors of sexual violence are due to deep-rooted patriarchal mindsets and unequal social norms. Therefore, community awareness programs have to be integrated with all other initiatives for reintegration of the survivors.\\n(The author is program coordinator at WOREC)\",\n",
       " '\\nDuring the first two months of this year, I worked as one of many doctors vaccinating people in the UK thus helping deliver COVID-19 protection to the elderly and the vulnerable. I returned to Nepal this month and wondered how reactions to the vaccine differed in the two countries. People in both often express concerns about the safety of a vaccine which has been produced so quickly. Usually vaccines take years to develop and yet a vaccine for COVID-19 was launched within a year of the identification of the COVID-19 virus: surely safety was compromised! Is this the case and how vaccines have been made so speedily?\\nGenerally, any new vaccine or medicine during development goes through a sequential series of trials for efficacy and safety. If at any stage it is found to be ineffective or dangerous, development ceases and no more money is spent on it. In the case of COVID-19 vaccines, pharmaceutical companies ran many of these trials parallelly. The correct normal procedures were still followed without cutting corners and compromising safety. The reasons that pharmaceutical companies dont usually do things this way is because of financial risk. In the case of COVID-19, various national governments financially supported a range of pharmaceutical companies allowing them to produce the vaccines speedily but safely and thus mitigate this financial risk. Numerous different vaccines were in development in many countries at the same time, and inevitably not all were successful. The vaccine that was being researched in France by Pasteur Institute, for example, proved ineffective and production ceased. Pasteur could not recoup any of its costs through vaccine sales, but the company was cushioned by government support.\\nThere has been a lot of discussion about which vaccine is best; efficacies have been quoted as highest for the Russian Sputnik vaccine and also the Pfizer and Moderna products at over 90%. The AstraZeneca or Oxford vaccine, which is the type that is being rolled out in Nepal, appears to have slightly lower efficacy. This has led to claims that this vaccine is being dumped in the third world. However, this is the vaccine that is being given to most people (70%) in Britain and it seems to have an excellent safety profile.\\nIt is important to remember that few vaccines give 100% protection against any specific disease. Even those that do so in theory, may fail if the cold chain is broken or there are other problems in delivery. Many vaccines have relatively low efficacies. For example, influenza vaccine is 40  60% effective, BCG probably around only 50% efficacious while typhoid is about 65% with zero protection against paratyphoid. It is difficult to say what the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine is as it is so new: it is at least 70% with one study suggesting it was 81% after a single dose. While studies in Scotland showed that administration of just one AstraZeneca dose reduced hospital admissions by 94% compared to a reduction of up to 85% for Pfizer. The immune response to the vaccine depends on which strain of the virus is circulating, whether an absolute protection is quoted against even mild disease as well as serious and deadly cases, the amount of vaccine given, the dosing interval and probably also the age of the person being vaccinated.\\nPfizer and Moderna vaccines are reported to have good efficacies (above 90%) but need to be kept frozen at very low temperatures (-70C and -20C respectively) making the risk of vaccine spoilage real, especially in a region where there are frequent power cuts and poor transportation facilities. The AstraZeneca vaccine is more robust and just needs to be kept in an ordinary fridge.\\nChinas Sinovac is being rolled out in Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia, Singapore and other countries and, while its efficacy is reported to be the least good of all the vaccines, it is still above the 50% required for regulatory approval. Although it does seem to have a relatively low efficacy against preventing all symptoms, importantly it appears to be powerful in preventing severe disease and death. Despite having an efficacy that may be lower than other vaccines, this will still help protect us all when large numbers of people are vaccinated. It is sad that there is so much discussion about which vaccine is best and that this has become a political issue or a matter of national pride. French President Emmanuel Macron was inappropriately critical of the successful British AstraZeneca vaccine perhaps partly in reaction to the failure of the French vaccine. It is important that as many of us get vaccinated as possible. Politics should steer clear of this, except perhaps to curb profits. Pfizer are reportedly making 80% on each ampule of vaccine it sells while AstraZeneca is distributing at cost. Lets accept whatever vaccine is being offered and listen to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus who repeatedly says that none of us is safe until we are all safe. By this he means it is a global priority for as many people to get jabbed as is possible, and let us not worry about theoretical efficacy comparisons.\\nSafety, of course, is a different matter. The very high death rates in the UK has stimulated a good response from the government and more than a third of the British adult population has been vaccinated to date. Thats more than 22 million people. In Nepal, some elderly people and those with medical conditions worry that the vaccine may harm them since perhaps they think that their bodies are weak but the UK program started with such elderly people (including the 94-year-old Queen and her 99-year-old husband Prince Philip) and people with multiple medical conditions because they are at greatest risk of dying from COVID-19. The people of Nepal can be reassured that UK citizens have done an excellent and reassuring safety trial!\\nAs a routine, vaccinators (both in Nepal and the UK) ask people about allergies and other medical details although there are a very few reasons not to have the vaccine. There is no problem for people with multiple medical conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiac or kidney ailments taking the vaccine. It is probably best avoided in pregnancy and anyone with multiple severe allergies (particularly those causing collapse and needing hospital admission) should probably take the vaccine at a health post or hospital.\\nIn the UK, patients went straight home after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine but were asked not to drive or cycle for 15 minutes. Short-term side-effects after the vaccine are to be expected and are reported in more than one in 10 people. Side-effects seem to be more common in younger rather than older people (over the age of 65) and in women more than men. Most people have a slight local pain at the site of the injection. People who take blood-thinners might expect a little bruising at the site of the injection, although the needle is very fine. (I take blood thinners but did not experience this problem) Some people experience body aches and fever but only for a day or so and paracetamol helps those who are feeling uneasy. A few feel quite unwell for nearly a week after receiving the vaccine, but this is a small cost for protection against a potentially fatal disease.\\nLet us all keep each other safe by accepting the vaccine when it is offered and continuing mask-wearing and maintaining social distancing until we are all vaccinated. The governments have briefed the people but increased dissemination of accessible information by it and major stakeholders would reassure the public and improve trust.\\n(The author is a British physician who has lived in Nepal for about nine years over the last 25 years or so.

       " '\\nIn many countries around the world, volunteerism is leveraged to help achieve societal changes and, as a complementary tool to public policies implemented by the government, it plays an important role in alleviating pressing problems faced by the people.\\nYou can find volunteers in action in every sector from conservation efforts to humanitarian support for those who are in most need.\\nNepal boasts a vibrant civil society, and solidarity and altruism have been unique features of the country well before even the term volunteerism was introduced here.\\nWe have seen how during the pandemic, volunteers in Nepal like in many other parts of the world got activated in multiple ways, from the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) to feeding those groups within the society who have been most affected by the lockdowns.\\nNow the country has a unique opportunity to bring volunteerism to the next level thanks to the formulation of a draft National Volunteering Policy that, once finalized and approved by the federal government, could herald a new era for the sector.\\nPrepared by the Policy Research Institute or PRI, a government-led public think tank, the draft policy is a key document that envisions the enabling conditions for volunteerism to better contribute to the national development process.\\nWith the ongoing economic crisis stemming from the pandemic forcing governments and civil society alike to re-think their traditional socio-economic models, there is no doubt that volunteerism can play a big role.\\nGlobally there has been an effort, led by the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) to broaden up and modernize the traditional boundaries and categories of volunteering action, acknowledging, very importantly, the existence of a so-called continuum that goes from more informal traditional forms of altruism that are so strong in many rural areas of Nepal to more organized forms of volunteering.\\nThe draft policy being worked out by PRI under the leadership of Dr Bishnu Upreti, is wide-ranging and encompassing this multifaceted nature of volunteerism in the country.\\nWith an ambitious vision of developing volunteering program in the form of effective medium for the social, cultural and economic transformation of the country, the draft also calls for further legislation that can codify and strengthen volunteerism in the country in future.\\nThe Philippines, for example, is one country in the Asia Pacific Region that has a solid volunteering infrastructure with a legislation and an appropriate supporting system provided by the government.\\nIt is exactly what the draft is calling for because without involvement of the federal, provincial and local governments--whose role is well recognized in the document--it will be impossible for Nepal to fully expand volunteering opportunities for all.\\nThis is why the fact the draft envisions a National Volunteering Promotion Center is so paramount.\\nThis is the institution that ultimately would play an indispensable role in enabling citizens from all walks of life to embrace volunteerism ensuring positive social outcomes.\\nWe need to ensure that such institution is going to have the necessary resources and institutional autonomy to become the key national actor in promoting and facilitating volunteerism.\\nInterestingly the draft policy will enable volunteerism as a springboard to equip youths and older working-age citizens alike to find and create employment opportunities.\\nWith Nepal aiming to graduate from the least developing status, it is indispensable to have innovative tools to promote new skills that will be meaningful in the job market and volunteerism is definitely one of them.\\nThe drafters were also innovative in recognizing the role that non-resident Nepalis could have in promoting volunteerism because the national diaspora, if properly cultivated, could have a big role in helping develop the country by engaging in well-formulated and planned volunteering activities.\\nThe facilities envisioned by the draft are in this sense progressive also because they try to bring clarity and legitimacy to properly managed and, most importantly, effective volunteering efforts by foreigners, an issue that has always been sensitive.\\nEnsuring a strong National Volunteering Promotion Center that perhaps could be renamed in a way that would give it a stronger mandate, beyond just promotion, is vital.\\nFor example it could be named National Volunteering Council, an institution that the draft for now describes the highest level decision making committee in matter of volunteerism as.\\nChaired by federal Minister for Youth and Sports with participation of Social Development Ministers of seven provinces and the secretaries and other top policy makers, such council, the draft states, will coordinate with another body, the Volunteering Program Implementation Committee that will itself supervise the National Volunteering Promotion Center.\\nAt the end of the day, no matter the names to be given to the different institutions in charge of volunteerism, what counts is to have a well-resourced but also at the same time lean and agile implementing body that, while fully accountable to the policy makers, will be capable not only to supervise and monitor but also enable strong and effective volunteering activities.\\nThe stronger such body is, the more chances the sector will have to prosper and thrive with better social outcomes on the ground.\\nThe fact that the draft also calls for such body to coordinate a web portal managing the supply and demand of volunteers bodes well for the sector.\\nThis is important because volunteering, as well-stated by the draft policy, can have positive effects also on the education sector, equipping students with new learning and serving experiences that will enrich their learning process.\\nHaving local units or volunteering centers under the supervision of local governments could be another fundamental element to truly enable an effective system that facilitates citizens, including the most vulnerable ones, to contribute to national development, helping Nepal achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\\nLast but not the least the process that led to formulation of the draft has been even more interesting because it was based on a real collaboration that saw an innovative public research institution partnering with civil society organizations, all passionately involved in promoting volunteerism, with the UNV as a key facilitator and enabler.\\nThe fact that such partnerships have been enabled could itself be the best practice.\\nNow it is up to the citizens of Nepal, not only activists and practitioners, to get engaged and ensure that draft can be improved.\\nDiscussions, on the ground in all the seven provinces and also virtually, are being held to ensure that the draft document can get the attention that is due and also the much-needed feedbacks and suggestions.\\nThe country has a unique opportunity to achieve the Agenda 2030 by leveraging volunteerism. Best of luck Nepal!\\n(This Sunday, 28th of Feb at 3pm and on Monday, 1st of March, an on-line event will take place to learn about and discuss the policy. You can register here: http://bit.ly/3bB8Wql)\\nThe author writes about volunteerism and social issues in Nepal.

       " \"\\nI was 12 or 13 years old when I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to join a remembrance tour to some concentration camps across Austria and Germany.\\nIt was an experience as shocking as transformational for me and I do still vividly remember walking around the Dachau camp, one of the biggest and most deadly among all the extermination sites across Europe.\\nThe fact that the Embassy of Israel, the Embassy of Germany, the Delegation of the European Union to Nepal and the United Nations in Nepal joined hands to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust is significant also for Nepal.\\nBecause, though very far from here, the deliberate attempt at suppressing and exterminating one entire civilization and culture during the World War II, should remind us at the same time how vicious human beings can turn out to be but also the spirit of forgivingness that can help us heal and become better persons.\\nIndeed, the Holocaust is a universal story, the biggest tragedy faced by our humanity and at the same time, it is a great example how victims and perpetrators can come together in a spirit of peace and reconciliation.\\nIt is a story not just about what Jews had to endure not only during the World War II but also in the years before that, crucial years in which anti-Semitism grew exponentially, day by day, throughout Europe, fueled by harsh rhetoric that at the end normalized hatred and led to millions being killed.\\nUnfortunately the seeds of what happened then might, tragically, lead us to more tragedies now fueled by a hatred toward others that are just different from us.\\nInstead of getting rid of racism and discriminations, the era we are living through is more and more bogged down by misconceptions, stereotypes, charged emotions against particular minorities, a phenomenon echoed by a pervasive social media that have been working as echo chambers to disseminate disinformation and falsehoods.\\nRemembering the Holocaust in Nepal is important because at its roots there is a fundamental racist view of the world that comes from ignorance, fear and insecurity.\\nUnfortunately there is no country around the world that is immune from these and while it is true that a genocide is something monstrously different from any other type of crimes that happened so far in the modern history, there are links and common points between all types of violence based on discriminatory attitudes.\\nThough it can take different forms and shapes, at the core of the enabling factors that led to extermination of millions of Jewish people is a view of the society that somehow some are better than others, that some are deemed to be the culprits of existing problems even though the underlying rationale of such accusations are totally baseless.\\nWe should be extremely careful to draw comparisons of what happened in Europe between the World War I and events in other parts of the world.\\nEncouragingly now there is an international legal framework--there is a convention against racism, there is the international convention upholding human rights universally and there is much more awareness about what can lead to a genocide.\\nAnd yet we are witnessing how racism including anti-Semitism is spreading in Europe and in North America, where even a recent football game in Milan had one of the most successful football player mocking with a racist remark his opponent, also a remarkable and extremely talented athlete but with a different skin color.\\nOne thing can lead to another and we should be really careful to condone small remarks, even those that are being made unconsciously.\\nIt is from these subtle discriminations that stronger and more vocal forms of racism originate, kicking off a sort of snowball effect that can truly lead to more serious forms of crimes, including violence.\\nEducation against racism, against the pre-concepts that are inborn in each of us, education for a better understanding is indispensable.\\nThats why the fact that the Higher Institutions and Secondary Schools' Association Nepal (HISSAN) has joined the official commemorations on what is officially called the International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust also known internationally as International Holocaust Remembrance Day is important.\\nCivic education plays a key role in shaping students view of their country and the world.\\nPatriotism is definitely an important element of civic education but discussions about it should not set aside talks about other aspects that can make a country not only great and prosperous but just.\\nAs an European I am encouraged by the actions being taken by the European Commission to fight anti-Semitism and other forms of racism but as someone deeply in love with Nepal, I also would like to see schools and colleges around the country to better embed their civic education classes with elements of social justice, human rights, all elements that are the foundations of what this country is aspiring to become.\\nIn this there is no country that can really teach others on how to model the perfectly equitable and just society.\\nIt is going to be a work in construction everywhere and we can all learn from each other.\\nMy dear friend Michael Rosenkrantz who for several years has been living in Nepal and who had many family members killed during the Holocaust, shares to me:\\nThere is still anti-Semitism in existence because people are very tribal. Its not just about anti-Semitism but is just a general dislike of others who dont look like us.\\nWe often relate to each other more for our differences than for what we have in common. We can see how this is pervasive in the United States and in Europe as well.\\nPerhaps as human beings we are wired for this but I believe we can always be better and the way Germany has embraced its moral failures during the World War II is exemplary.\\nNo genocides have been committed in Nepal but discrimination in many forms is still rampant.\\nNepal has a real opportunity to instill positive and universal values among its youths to lay the foundation for a better nation.\\nHaving one week of awareness about the Holocaust as it has been planned by the organizers of the Holocausts commemoration this year is going to be important but how can we attach more meaning to the concept of active citizenship, one that does a better job at internalizing the principles enshrined in the Constitution of this country with its quest for peace, harmony and justice?\\nWhile it is true that Nepal has been progressing on its human rights agenda, the recent universal review of its human rights performance also shows that there are still many gaps, not only at the policy level.\\nMy visit to Dachau shaped me in so many ways.\\nTalking about the tragedies of our past generations, even if they occurred far away and decades ago, can help us become better and truly push for a more equitable, just Nepal, a country that can become a paragon for upholding human rights.\\n(Galimberti is the Co-Founder of ENGAGE, an NGO partnering with youths to promote social inclusion in Nepal.

       " \"\\nIn an agricultural country like Nepal, where 66% of the population are farmers, and livestock covers 32% of agricultural GDP, one would expect the dairy industry to flourish as a testament to their toil. Yet, reality paints a different picture, revealing a disheartening tale of missed opportunities and untapped potential. The Milk Industry in Nepal has long been plagued by inefficiency and financial losses, primarily represented by the struggles faced by the Dairy Development Corporation (DDC). For decades, this state-owned entity has failed to achieve profitability, resulting in significant financial burdens on the nations hardworking taxpayers. This article delves into the pressing need for the privatization of Nepal's state owned DDC, highlighting its inefficiencies and the implications of its continued financial strain on the taxpayers. The article also advocates for a transition of the role of government in this sector that would alleviate this burden and foster a more vibrant and self-sustaining industry.\\nFirstly, lets start by talking about the market for milk in Nepal. As per FAO/WHO, the demand for milk in Nepal is 92 liters per person per year, and the country produces 79 liters per person annually. It is estimated that the average current deficit is around 550,000 liters of fluid milk per day with 10-20 % variability during different seasons. According to the Department of Livestock Services (DLS), production is increasing at a rate of 3.4 % annually, but demand is growing at 8%. The average cost of per liter milk production in Nepal is around Rs 56.32. It is lowest in Ilam at Rs 45.37 per liter and highest in Sarlahi, at Rs 67 per liter.\\nWhen it comes to dairy development in Nepal DDC is a living history. However, like other state-owned enterprises in Nepal, it has inbuilt difficulties and incompetency. DDC is a significant player in the market, handling a disproportionately high share of 40% of milk production in the country. Regardless of a substantial market share over the past five years, the corporation has been experiencing massive financial losses. In the fiscal years 2019/20 and 2020/21, the company incurred losses of Rs 158.3 million and Rs 168 million, respectively. The loss trend continues in the year 2022 and 2023 which is substantiated by ongoing protests across various regions in Nepal, led by milk farmers affected by DDC's untimely payment practices. While other dairy companies are flourishing and expanding their portfolio DDCs continuous loss alone is enough to prove its incompetency. Lets delve deeper into the reasons behind the inefficiencies of the DDC, shedding light on the factors that have led to its downfall.\\nSupply Chain Incompetency\\nIn 2020, DDC requested a concessional loan of Rs 300 million from the Ministry of Finance, facilitated through the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development. DDC had been unable to pay farmers for their milk for the past three months. According to them, there was approximately Rs 1 billion worth of dairy products in stock as they were not able to sell the product. DDC had also requested a subsidy of Rs 5 per liter from the Ministry of Agriculture for the consumption of 17 million liters of milk. This highlights a significant supply chain inefficiency as DDC, despite being a majority shareholder in the market, fails to capitalize on the existing deficit of 550,000 liters per day in the milk market.\\nLack of Efficient Decision Making\\nDuring COVID, after DDC bought up to 100,000 liters of milk every day, they had problems managing the milk. Hence, the provincial government provided Rs 50 million grant to upgrade the powder plant to be able to operate 24 hours a day and establish a new ice bank. The Biratnagar Milk Supply Scheme (BMSS), which upgraded the powder plant by expecting an increase in milk collection, is now, at times, completely non-operational till the interval of up to half a year due to insufficient milk collection. The BMSS is currently collecting 10,000 liters of milk daily. During the same period last year, the daily collection was 22,000 liters. Not only is DDC unable to meet the market demand, it has stopped the production of cheese. Their ghee has not been sent to the market for months. The short-term thinking and lack of foresightedness among the decision-makers have cost the taxpayers in millions.\\nUntimely Payment to Suppliers\\nIn March 2023, the government fixed the minimum purchase price of raw milk containing four units of fat at Rs 65 per liter for the farmers. However, Farmers opt to sell their milk to private companies instead of DDC due to the private sector's provision of more competitive pricing and timely payment, thereby aligning with their economic interests. Private industries are buying milk by paying Rs 5-10 more per liter. The private sector is giving advance payment to the cooperatives, but DDC has been buying milk on credit for two months. Among the farmers, DDC has been known as a 'slow pay' company. The milk collection capacity of BMSS has been decreasing at a rate of 50 percent every year for the past few years. The Biratnagar project is in trouble as DDC is unable to bring milk from Ilam, where it collects the most milk. Until three years ago, about 12,000 liters of milk was collected daily from Ilam, now 3,000 liters are collected daily. Farmers are unwilling to sell milk to DDC due to due to lack of timely payment. Hence, the reluctance of farmers to sell milk to DDC, despite the milk production capacity of Nepal remaining intact, highlights the perceived inefficiency of DDC in effectively engaging with farmers and establishing a mutually beneficial relationship. This demonstrates the superior efficiency of the private sector in this industry, as it not only offers competitive prices to farmers but also manages to sell milk to consumers at the same price as DDC. Consequently, this approach avoids any loss of taxpayers' money.\\nInefficient Use of Resources\\nIn Nepal, there are two seasons based on milk production at the farmers' level. During the lean season, the demand for milk is higher than the supply and during the flush season, the demand is lower than the supply. Even today, DDC is not able to buy all the milk offered by the farmers, especially during the flush season. As a consequence, DDC imposes a milk holiday on certain days during the period when they do not buy any milk from the farmers. On the other hand, during the lean season, DDC has either been importing skimmed milk powder to meet consumer demand or buying milk from private companies. In the Indian market, the base price of milk stands at Rs 70 per liter, whereas in Nepal, it is merely Rs 64 per liter. The inability of DDC to powder and store milk exclusively during the flush season not only leads to significant financial losses for the organization but also imposes these losses on the general public. If private companies can efficiently utilize resources and maintain a consistent price throughout all seasons, there is little justification for bailing out DDC, which has been purchased from these very private companies at the expense of public losses.\\nCorruption and Lack of Accountability\\nLack of accountability and corruption is a very common cause of inefficiency of Public Enterprises in Nepal. The stakeholders often act on their self-interests rather than the interests of the organization as they have very little incentive to maximize the organizational profit. Additionally, the government often appoints unqualified or underqualified individuals to top positions based on political connections rather than merit, resulting in poor decision-making, lack of accountability, and a culture of corruption. DDC is indifferent to this and has been plagued by inefficiency due to rampant corruption within the organization. This has hindered the corporation's ability to fulfill its objectives and has negatively impacted its overall performance. One glaring example is highlighted in a report from 2016 which exposed DDC officials who were found involved in accepting commissions. Such unethical practices not only undermine the corporation's integrity but also result in the misallocation of resources and compromised decision-making processes. When officials prioritize personal gain over the interests of the organization, it leads to inefficiencies in the procurement, production, and distribution of dairy products.\\nFurthermore, another report shed light on another form of corruption within DDC which revealed instances where service-seekers were forced to pay bribes to officials in Saptari DDC. This kind of extortion erodes public trust in the corporation and discourages genuine service-seekers from engaging with the organization. It also creates an uneven playing field, where those with connections or the ability to pay bribes receive preferential treatment, further exacerbating the inefficiencies of the organization.\\nLack of Audit Reports\\nThe absence of audit reports of DDC for seven consecutive years raises significant questions about the financial transparency and accountability of the organization. Audits play a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial statements, detecting fraud or mismanagement, and providing insights into the overall financial health of a company. The lack of audits undermines these essential functions, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and casting doubts on the financial integrity of DDC. These reasons could range from administrative negligence to deliberate attempts to conceal financial irregularities. This raises an alarming question as to why no one has taken action or asked questions about the missing audits. This is related to accountability and governance mechanisms of DDC and the government itself. It is crucial for stakeholders, including government authorities, regulatory bodies, and the general public, to demand transparency and seek answers regarding the reasons behind the missing audits. Without regular audits, it becomes difficult to assess financial performance, identify areas for improvement, and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Lack of transparency in the organization has led to mismanagement, corruption, and resource wastage, further hindering the efficiency of DDC.\\nTo conclude, to enhance efficiency and improve the dairy market in Nepal, it is imperative for the government to adopt effective policies that focus on fostering a thriving milk industry rather than directly engaging in business operations. For instance, one of the major factors contributing to the low milk production in Nepal is the limited milk yield of the local cow breeds. Currently, only 5% of the cattle in Nepal are pure breeds such as Holstein and Jersey, which are known for their higher yield. To address this issue, Nepali farmers have resorted to artificial insemination (AI) to crossbreed their local cattle with Holstein and Jersey breeds. However, despite these efforts, the average milk yield per cow ranges from 500 to 2,000 liters per year, which falls short of desired levels. To tackle these challenges and revitalize the dairy market, the government can facilitate the import of high-yielding dairy cows. By streamlining the process and making it more accessible for businesses and corporations to import such cows, Nepal can significantly boost milk production.\\nSimilarly, encouraging foreign direct investment (FDI) in the dairy sector can yield substantial benefits. For instance, if renowned brands like Amul are allowed to enter Nepal, they can bring advanced technologies, expertise, and cooperative models. It is important to dispel the misconception spread by interest groups that such investment will negatively impact local milk farmers. In reality, international brands will still rely on local farmers for their milk supply. Additionally, the comparative affordability of milk in Nepal compared to neighboring India ensures that Nepali farmers will not suffer from a lack of demand. In fact, increased competition and demand from foreign brands entering the market will incentivize farmers to produce more milk. Hence, the government should prioritize the best interests of the overall population rather than succumbing to pressure from interest groups.\\nLastly, the government must take decisive steps to ensure free market competition in the dairy sector and limit its crucial role in standardizing milk quality through the implementation of effective quality control measures. Introducing a free-market framework and fostering healthy competition are essential as they empower the market to self-regulate, eliminating substandard milk products that fall short of meeting consumer demands. In a truly free market, local participants will be driven to standardize their milk products to compete effectively. As a result, only the highest quality milk will prevail in the market, benefiting consumers by guaranteeing their access to safe and nutritious dairy products. Embracing such a market-oriented approach is pivotal for the industry's long-term growth and sustainability, as it encourages innovation, efficiency, and the continual improvement of product offerings. By facilitating an environment where quality is the hallmark, the government can inspire consumer trust, foster economic development, and position Nepal's dairy sector as a beacon of excellence both domestically and internationally.\",\n",
       " \"\\nUniversities in Nepal, along with their numerous affiliated colleges in various domains of specialization, havegradually acknowledged and embraced the importance of research as an integral part of their academic practices. After all,research activities enable scholars in any domain of knowledgesociology, economics, education, engineering, or managementto either examine or explore the relationship between their academic learning and practices, preferences, possibilities, and problems that are emerging in real-world settings. Through research activities, scholars can also acquire essential professional skills like the application of concepts, processes, steps, and theories learned in academia for the analysis of real-world problems, data management, inference, contextualization, and evidence-based interpretations. As a result, educational institutions associated with Nepali higher educationregularly organize conferences, seminars, research workshops, and data analysis training sessions to support their scholars and faculty members with publications and participation in different conferences.\\nHowever,so much of the research-based knowledge and evidence generated in Nepali academia never gets implemented in practice that there is a huge research-professional practice gap in Nepali higher education. Therefore, it is no surprise that the libraries of universities find it worthless to keep archives of graduate projects, post-graduate theses, and dissertations; hence, after some time, most of them are simply sold off to scrap dealers.\\nSince university educators, research scholars, andprofessors observe and analyze professional and social realities from their academic norms and hypotheses, there is a common assumption that academicsdont produce anything useful for society, the economy, or business in practical or applied terms. This assumption is also justified by the fact that inNepali academic circles, so much of the research activities are framed on the basis of reviews of existing theories, concepts, and published literature, or approaches to research that some professors and faculty members presume to be most reliable and valid. Hence, academic research lacks propergrounding in research problems, contextual knowledge gaps, practices, and selections of factors and issues that are observable and emerging in a real-world setting.\\nAs we can observe in management studies, where thousands of dissertations are completed with reference to the Nepali financial sector, this sector is utterly aloof, disinterested, and indifferent to the knowledge and evidence generated by these research works. After all, just because there is a concept doesn't mean that the problems and practices of commercial banks can be grounded in that conceptual framework; relationships between concepts in theory may not have any relation to practice. For example, work-life balance may be an emerging concept in management, but to most professionals working in the banking sector, the issue of balancing work and life may never occur to their minds in spite of all the hectic schedules, stress, and workloads. Perhaps imbalances between work and life are integral part of the competitive working culture of commercial banks.\\nHence, publication for the sake of publication can be a criteria for professor tenure and university ranking, but that is certainly not a concern for any dynamic, competitive, and vibrant organization like a commercial bank.That is whymost of the students are not passionate about doing their theses and wantto outsource the process or streamline it with every possible shortcut. Even if they publish research in a highly ranked journal, they know it has zero professional or financial value beyond the walls of the university.\\nMore importantly, when academic research occurs within operative closures, where none of the research activities move out of the university system, various malpractices, misuses, and manipulations also begin to emerge, as we see when a senior professor or a dean publishes journal articles with scholars or young lecturers as co-authors, and we don't know who among them has contributed the most to the final research paper or if the names of others have simply been added due to hierarchy or power structure. That is why we can find in Nepal the names of some people hanging behind as co-authors in different research papers, although they dont themselves have any specializations in that domain of knowledge.Hence, in most cases, academic research only remains a self-maximizing tool for professors, deans and senior lecturers, despite the agony and hard work of young faculty members and scholars.\\nMoreover, when we analyze this isolated and self-referential aspect of academic research happening in Nepali higher education, we also realize why universities are not developing their students into scientists, engineers, innovators, entrepreneurs, disruptive thinkers, system designers, theorists, and paradigm shifters capable of solving real-life problems and making contributions to the progress of overall society. Our professors and lecturers have only remained artists, admiring their own creations with utter arrogance and self-admiration, whereas most people outside their close system are not interested in their art. As a result of this self-admiring tendency, we observe thatdifferent departments of universities keep on producing research dissertations and articles on different events, experiences, and circumstances using the same research methodologies over and over again.\\nHowever, to remain competitive, relevant, and vibrant in an international market,universities in Nepal need to undertake research activities that have applied value for scientific, business, industrial, and technological development, where evidence, trends, tendencies and interpretations generated through research have analytical, practical, decision-making, and problem-solving potential for businesses and entrepreneurs. Likewise, universities, rather than operating as a closed system, need to collaborate with stakeholders in higher education through knowledge sharing platforms to ground theirresearch activities in real-world issues and ground-based observations that are pertinent to professionals and decision-makers in public and private institutions so that research findings generated in institutions of higher learning are applicable for expanding and enhancing the quality, sustainability, optimization, efficacy, and effectiveness of professional practices.\\nMore importantly, it is for universities in Nepal to realize that research with scientific, innovative, social, and professional potentials, utility, and relevance not only enhances the perceived value and reputation of Nepali universities and educational institutions of higher education in terms of grants, market outreach, funds, and investment collaborations but also indicates to potential students that universities in Nepal, like foreign academic institutions, are also involved in solving real-life scientific, social, economic, business, and industrial problems.\",\n",
       " \"\\nIt appears that the current generation of loving couples getting married in Nepal in an urban context are enchanted and enthralled by the idea of a soulmate. Hence, the idea of someone being your soulmate keeps trending on different social networking sites as an ideal version of being in love together. Although the current generation of loving couples has an idealized image of a soulmate, in reality, for many people, the idea of finding and living with a social mate remains limited to mere appearancesjust a tagline posted along with a visual representation of togetherness shared on different social networking sites.\\nOur everyday idea about the soulmate falls short of its ideals because werely on imitations of plastic images of love trending in different mediums of pop culture, compare and contrast our possible loving partners with superficial expressions of other loving couples, and also follow the suggestions and guidelines of other people to identify and determine our soulmate.Similarly, we have misguided expectations about a soulmate as someone who brings a sense of security and feelings of comfort, along with the promise of everlasting love, into our lives.\\nBesides, our criteria forfalling in love with another person are such that we give more preference and priority to what the person has, like abank balance, a green card,a dependent visa,social status, and a handsome or beautiful face, than to who he or she is as a person with inner human qualities such as honesty, trustworthiness, understanding, commitment, and caring.\\nMany people miss their soulmates because they are so out of touch with their inner lives as individuals that they remain unaware of the person who is carrying the beats of her heart inside his own.Soulmates get married because they are for each other, not for any other reason.\\nMore importantly, without anything as such to connect with, enrich, and nourish a loving relationship together from within, being in love without a soulmate becomes utterly boring, shallow, lost in appearances, and meaningless. Being in love without a soulmate is a tedious struggle of finding one temporary delight after another in the outer world to justify and demonstrate the shallow and soulless love people have for each other.\\nThe idea of each of us having a soulmate was first put forth by Greek philosopherPlato, who in his seminal work Symposium stated that each of us has another half of our own soul in another physical body; hence, as human beings, we have this inner, irresistibleyearningfor that interconnection with another being thatwould make us feel undivided and complete, and as long as soulmates remain separated, there will always be an inner sense of lack, as if things are missing out, out of touch, shallow, and incomplete.\\nSimilarly, in Hindu religious tradition, we have thedivineunion between Goddess Parvati andLord Shivaas Shiva and Shakti expressed in a singular being, Ardhanarishwar; thismythological narrative is a symbolic representation of reunion between soulmates. Indeed, the struggles and sacrifices of Devi Parvati to belong with Lord Shiva indicate thatwhen it comes to a spiritual journey to find a soulmate, it is not about what other people say or what options or preferences you have; to find a soulmate, you must exercise your freedom, follow your inner voice and its determination, and stand strong with your courage. First, you have to connect and stand firm on your true self to find your true lover.\\nHence, to get in touch with your soulmate, first of all, you need to listen to the soft whisper reverberating from your heart that gently tells you she may not be the charming person of your dreams, but it feels as if even as strangers, we have already met for thousands of times.There may have been other lovers of youth, beauty, possession, admiration, and passion, but only she can reach deep inside your heart and understand you just the way you are.\\nFinding your soulmate would be like stumblingonto someone you are surprised to realizehas been shaped and carved like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that fit together only with you. With your soulmate, you get that feeling of being at ease within yourself, and there is no need for any other stimulus or incentive apart from each others presence to get a sense of interconnection out of this relationship.\\nMoreover, soulmates are two individuals who have realized that promising romantic love forever is a lie. Falling in love is easy, but the art of remaining committed to each other in love takes many years of practice to perfect. Even when theirlove is the glue that binds them together, soulmates understand that for their relationship to last,they need to support each other's motivations, interests, and inspirations and find commonalities between them.\\nBeing in love as soulmates means that we are both willing to make struggles and sacrifices for each other because we both realize that our love has the potential to improve, transform, redefine, and make the best out of our lives altogether. Besides, soulmates dont play the game of pretending to remain at the center of each others attention, and they don't want the other person to become the shadow of their expectations, anticipations, and projections.\\nTo conclude, soulmates are two individuals with a sense of shared self that allows them to blend in, support, and sustain each other's beings together. Where there are differences, soulmates supplement and become each others inspiration and strength, and where there are similarities, they explore, enhance, and enjoy their mutual interests and passions together. When soulmates sit together and engage in laughter, dialogue, making love, silence, or discussions, they realize that their loving relationship gives their lives a sense of purpose together, which makes them feel complete and inseparable from each other.\\n(The author is a writer, researcher and educator at different educational institutions.

       " '\\nThose words from my lovely wife ended our argument in the kitchen last night.\\nThe night before that, a minor difference in opinion had flickered into a tiny spark and by the time Hegel got involved the next day, it had turned into an inferno.\\nBefore we move on, lets get to know a little about Hegel so it can help us understand where these two loving souls, my wife and I, usually depart and seldom meet again.\\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a German Philosopher and was considered as the most important figures in German philosophy and one of the founding figures of modern Western philosophy. Leaving all the things hes said aside, the one thing that has struck a chord with me is his theory on shape of consciousness.\\nHegel says simply put, we cannot trust the certitude of our sense organs, also called sense-certainty, because that certitude is embroiled in limitations. Add to that, the human consciousness, and language upon which all sense-making is forced. That leaves no room for subjective agency. Our means of understanding our reality are encouraged, sustained, inspired, and tolerated by those sets of very weak and humanistic attributes. We are flawed in our take of our reality because the moment we set our eyes on something, it takes a form of what it means for us.\\nNot what it is in its real essence, but what it means to a human mind.\\nImagine a botanist, a wood cutter and a CEO of a furniture company taking a walk in a forest. What they see when they look around are trees and nothing but trees.\\nIn essence what a tree is, in-itself, they will never know. They cannot catch themselves seeing those trees from anywhere else beyond what their human mind lets them see.\\nThe botanist will see the trees in terms of cambiums and apical meristem.\\nThe woodcutter will see those trees in terms of his livelihood and his childrens tuition.\\nThe CEO will see them in terms of how many desks his company could produce from the wood of those trees.\\nThe trees essence, what it is, and why it is what it is, can never find a place of its individuality because the human mind, limited within its Hegelian purview, will eat up that possibility before anything else.\\nThe tree can never be a tree in itself. Instead, it must be a tree for those three people.\\nThomas Nagel, one of my other to-go thinkers wrote a paper back in 1974 titled What is it like to be a bat? There is no amount of knowledge or information about a bat that can tell us what it feels like to be a bat within the confines of its bat consciousness.\\nIts hunger, its love, its breezing along the meandering swoops and its revulsions against other fellow bats--thosewe shall never know. The best we could do is anthropomorphize it, like we always do in animation movies where animals tend to live up to human aspirations.\\nA human mind is incapable of experiencing a bats experience and therefore will never know how a bat might feel. There simply is not a way for anyone of us to know.Lets be totally asserted on that truth.\\nIn the similar manner, a botanist, a woodcutter, and my lovely wife, hows their experience any more different from the run-down of that bats experience we could relate to?\\nFundamentally, their personal experience thats accessible only to them, be it during the stroll in the forest or the grunt in the kitchen, are theirs to have. I can sit here and try to relativize a woodcutters coveting or my wifes annoyances, but that wont move the dial if their shape of consciousness is absent from my reach. I can never know how she feels if I cant own her in totality.\\nAnd this is where Hegel comes along to enlighten the predicament of the misrepresentations that becomes a foundational springboard in understanding the shape of the other persons consciousness.\\nOur minds, our feelings and everything we claim as ours are cusped within the confines of our personal sense-making. Our experiences become relatable only if we can find a medium to universalize it in terms of human graces or grunts.\\nI dont know if Hegel can truly do my wifes dishes or not.\\nI am positive he will not because he died long before both of us were born.\\nNonetheless, Hegel does remind us that in absence of common reference, our words will fail us miserably.\\nAnd when that happens our silence, perhaps, will hold more meaning.',\n",
       " \"\\nA dear friend that I have known for decades took his life last week leaving behind a wife, two children and many of us who have not been able to claim back our sanity. There are ten thousand unrelenting questions that are hitting hard on us, and they are not easily going away. Its been an unsettling week for all of us.\\nWhen a tragedy like this happens, it doesnt take place amidst the clamor of reason and resonance.\\nInstead, a decision like this is made in the retreat of a cool, calm, and collected mind. At least, thats what Karl Menninger meditates in Man against Himself, a brilliant psychiatrist who tries to comprehend why an individual wishes to put himself in a harms way from which he cannot, except by suicide, escape from his life.\\nIn other words, if for his own unconscious purpose, a man brings about an apparent justification in external reality for self-destruction, then the unconscious purposes are of more significance in understanding the suicide than the apparently simple, inevitable, external circumstance that are observable to the public. For folks like you and me, the laziest and the most reckless way to make sense of someones decision is to try to understand his subjective decision from an objective point of view.\\nWhat Menninger is saying humbly is this.\\nWhat happens out there are particles simply hitting each other and producing a state of affairs that, when viewed from a frogs point of view or a bird eye-view, are nothing but occasions passing along space and time. However, when we introduce a human mind to that same state of affairs, everything changes.\\nHumans carry an unhealthy number of covenants, rules, positivity, and ought-to-be-ness that sometimes are anti-life. It works more against them than for them.\\nIn essence, what kills a man under such circumstances is not whats out there in the world but whats within him. His provisional compass becomes the contingent arbiter, the judge, the jury, and the noose that can take away his life. At least, thats what happened with my friend, it looks like.\\nI can only imagine or perhaps not, what must have gone through his mind in those last forlorn moments of despair and disquietude. I will never find out how many sins he thought he had committed when he compared his external world to Bhagavat Geeta that espouses on being a good human being. I will never find out how much short he found himself in the eyes of Hindu Gods and other deities that had, in his last moments, become toxic for him.\\nJordan Peterson is a clinical psychiatrist who perhaps is the most articulate man alive on our planet- at least thats what the New York Times quotes him to be.\\nPeterson makes an appeal to all, not to advise another human being on what should or should not be done, simply because you may screw up that persons life. It doesnt matter where such guidance comes from.\\nBe it from the voice from heaven or from the Apollo of Delphi or from our own Krishnas chariots from Kurukshetra. Where they come from is irrelevant but what they render to a human mind is absolutely calamitous.\\nThese oracular voices tend to be more harmful and are totally responsible for human suffering. They create a paradigm in men upon which he is constrained to build up his sense of right and wrong. And life, as you all know, is a roller coaster ride, simply because theres always a chance for us to spill out of that paradigm.\\nOur agency, perhaps our only tool to understand the reality may not always square perfectly with Bhagavad Gitas diatribes against the sins that men are capable of committing. And that is exactly why no one should be damned because none can control the reality of the world. There seems no room for agency in a world of neural impulses, chemical reactions, and bone and muscle movements. Even if we add sensations, perceptions, and feelings we dont get action, or doingthere is only what happens.\\nUnder such conditions, my friend who perhaps didnt find his external reality 'squarely checked with his internal covenants saw no point in prolonging his life because he must have gotten lost on his way with no structure to guide him through. The virtues that he adhered so deeply had no place in the world he found himself in. The gods were gone.\\nHe must have found himself in that forlorn Nietzschean world where god lived no more.\\nThere were two ways to fix his problem from what I can tell.\\nFirst one was to fix the reality which essentially meant to reorganize the particles that was noumenally visible to him so it would evenly square with his virtues.\\nThe second was to kill the gods so the world would become livable where he could breathe again.\\nUnfortunately, both options were not available to him.And the one that he did choose, only that made all the difference to him.\",\n",
       " \"\\nWith the massive popularity and abundance of spiritual leaders, gurus, religious groups, religious media channels, and self-help publications, theconcept of spirituality has become an integral part of our collective psyche. As a result, many people believe that spiritual perspectives, techniques, and exercises can be applied to solve various mental health issues and educational and behavioral problems in modern society and influence people to make healthy lifestyle choices and meaningful life decisions.However, most often, I find this term overused, misused, confused, and even utterly commercialized.\\nFor example, gurus, meditation teachers, mystics, yogic masters, and preachers package their spiritual techniques and craft their presence in such a way that their spiritual teaching resonates as informative, entertaining, alluring, and incentivized for a specific age group, gender, generation, profession, and for people with a specific way of life, attitude, and purchasing power. And these days, spirituality is no longer something that can be obtained without generous contributions; most of the spiritual reliefs available on the market have a price tag stitched around them.\\nOur familiar assumptions also limit our understanding of spirituality to becoming members of a spiritual sect, listening to spiritual teachers, following their instructions, and reading spiritual books regularly. But to become spiritual, one does not have to join an esoteric cult, put on religious markers, receive the spiritual energy transmission of a guru and his grace, or uncritically digest his outrageous teaching.\\nSigmund Freud, thefounder of psychoanalysis,observed that, based on our infantile experiences, it is part of human psychology to yearn for a father figure who can guide us through this chaotic, unpredictable, and confusing world. And there are different gurus, mystics, evangelists, and spiritual masters in the spiritual market ready to take up this role as father figures because, as humans, we want to live a meaningful life, find answers to the questions about our being and suffering, and overcome the fear of death. Besides, all of us also have that feeling of being unsatisfied by material comforts, things, and achievements.\\nAs a spiritual person, I am not opposed to anyone following any spiritual teacher; however, as a follower, you must be critical enough to question their self-contradictory and baseless statements, and also, under the guise of spiritual growth, you shouldnt be exploited, made vulnerable, or demanded to make irrational commitments and actions. We also need torealize that nobody in this world has a truth that doesnt need to be proved. I have met hundreds of spiritual teachers from different religious traditions, but I never forgot to keep my critical mind open. After all, the word spiritual comes from a Latin word meaning to breathe freely. As a result, becoming a free spiritthose who dare to challenge traditional beliefs, let go, and celebrate their liberationis also a part of human spirituality.\\nAs human existence is divided into mind and matter, we need abstract and soulful substances like poetry, ideas, music, art, literature, philosophy, self-inquiry, and reflections to help us find meaning and significance in our outer actions, associations, objectives, and outcomes from our inner perspectives. In other words, to live a meaningful life, we need to find somethingmusic, art, poetry, meditation, philosophy, or writingthat allows us to explore and engage with the outside world while maintaining our inner sense of balance, detachment, calmness, maturity, and acceptance. Hence, spirituality is a search for an equilibrium point that balances our inner and outer lives.\\nSpirituality awakens to a living reality that is self-sufficient initself, and nothing can be more spiritual than living in the world, where you find events, occasions, situations, relationships, explorations, and experiences that cantake you out of yourself and connect you with everyone and everything around you. We can also recognize our relative insignificance in the universe when we temporarily dissolve our egos. Similarly, spirituality urges us to embrace, adjust to, and enjoy all the recklessness and paradoxes of human life. There are contractions and confusions everywhere, but these paradoxes also make life deep, dynamic, vibrant, improbable, creative, and exciting.\\nSurely, life is unfair and unpredictable, andashuman beings, we have to deal with lots of people, events, occurrences, and outcomes that we don't like. Aseverything ends, every moment of life we live, touch, love, reflect on, listen to, connect with, and experience is special, specific, unrepeatable, and unparalleled. Hence, the journey of life becomes more spiritually meaningful than its presumed destinations. This is the only life we have; therefore, everything we do, discover, relate to, and create becomes significant and valuable because we will never have another opportunity to relive and restore those fleeting moments of life.After all, nothing can be more spiritual than to breathe in a world already overflowing with life, rhythm, a sense of wonder, beauty, and mystery.\\nWith intensity, depth of engagement, thoughtfulness, and passion, everything from meditation, yoga, and dance to driving, climbing mountains, having conversations, and having a cup of tea becomes a meaning-making process that is also spiritually enriching. Human spirituality is not something separate from our everyday lives.For example, by reading Chekhov, walking around in the woods, writing poetry, teaching, gazing at the stars, playing with my daughter, and learning the guitar, I am able to engage in a meaning-making process and also feel the connectedness of my being with other beings and nature. And there are numerous other ways to celebrate our spirituality in the midst of our daily activities and practices.Hence, spirituality is not the exclusive property of people with certain levels of spiritual awakening, and we do not need their blessings to become spiritual.\\nMore importantly, there is no need to elevate specific spiritual practices and religious rituals above any other ordinary human activities. With a little forethought, emotion engagement, love, passion, depth in involvement, and awareness in every ounce of our fleeting human existence, we can spiritualize our individual lives.\\n(The author is a writer, researcher and educator at different educational institutions.

       " \"\\nIn the age of consumerism, we as individuals are forming our mindsets and behaviors based on what we have learned from different advertisements, social media contents, blog posts, expert opinions, TikTok, celebrity endorsements on Instagram, TV reality shows, the latest viral trends and contents, product positioning, celebrity lifestyles, movies, and so on.\\nAs a result, we are influenced by the suggestions, persuasions, and symbolic meaning we have derived from these sources and develop our taste, preferences, decisions, comparisons, and lifestyle choices accordingly.\\nSimilarly, we also learn so much about loving relationships from the narratives of love symbolized in movies and songs. Likewise, we like to read guidebooks on the art of loving to enhance our love, replicate the love lives of different social media influencers, and make love decisions based on consumer values of use and disposal. When it comes to choosing gifts for your girlfriend, you also seek expert advice and adhere to their guidelines in order to provide her with the ultimate experience of your love.\\nJust to give an example of this learning because of the influence of pop songs these days, for modern lovers, breakup has simply become a natural or obvious stage of the love cycle, comparable to any other product life cycle where, after peak experiences of love, there will be decline and discontinuity.\\nBeing in love also becomes useless when excitement begins to weaken and the boredom of repetition starts to creep in, and at that moment, you canshake it off,as Taylor Swift reminded us; indeed, ifyou can't make him stay, you can at least shake him off. Breakups aren't tragic, brokenhearted, or sad. Don't waste your emotions grieving over him; save your emotions for someone else you'll find again.Now you are better off being apart than together, asThe Breakup Song lyrics from Ae Dil Hai Mushkilremind us, and breakups have become just another reason to reignite your passion, take charge of your life again, and party with friends rather than hang on and grieve over a stale relationship.\\nLikewise, we feel that exchanging various products developed as gifts and engaging in modern-day love rituals would prolong, strengthen, and enrich our loving relationships. Modern-day love rituals like Rose, Chocolate, and Teddy Days, candlelight dinners,Valentine's Day gift packages,anddiamond rings and bracelets make so much sense in consumer culture because the products and services that are available in the market can be used to signify and express a person's quantum of love.\\nLove has surely become costly. With so many products and services in the consumer market that symbolize and signify different features, dimensions, depths, and expressions of love, lovers need to have sufficient purchasing power to exchange, enjoy, and experience love in all its colors, exuberance, and facets.\\nFrom restaurants, vacations, shopping, birthday celebrations, night outs, romantic dates, and weekly gifts to movie theaters, different portions of love hang everywhere, and you need to purchase them to enrich your loving relationships. Indeed, you can consume these products and services with your partner in order to enhance your experience of being in love and make it more satisfying and exciting.\\nFalling in love in the age of consumerism becomes so irrelevant, less exciting, dull, and meaningless if you can't buy your portion of love.\\nAs a result, much of human love and relationship in this consumer age is nurtured by an individual's consuming capacity and purchasing power rather than genuine passion, sacrifice, a sense of togetherness, trust, support, and tolerance for each other. We have started to view people as commodities that can be exchanged, consumed, and disposed of.\\nMoreover, falling in love has become some kind of window shopping where we look for different categories of image, expectation, satisfaction, and anticipation in someone to fall in love with, just like we go through a catalog to find a suitable product with essential features, functions, qualities, possibilities, and consumer benefits. As with other products, if it serves our purpose, our relationship will last for years; otherwise, it will be dumped and replaced if it fails to meet our expectations.\\nBesides, based on our consumer mindset, we think that we can easily dump a person and find a replacement rather than engage in the difficult tasks of acceptance, accommodations, and conflict resolution. After all, a loving relationship is interchangeable from the standpoint of a consumer; thus, like any rational consumer, we are free to dispose of the other person when we are confident enough to realize that we can now possess an upgraded model than what we currently have.\\nIn the age of consumerism, our ways of loving and being in relationships also resemble how we would interact with and react to any other consumer product available on the market. Loving someone is just a part of consumer behavior.\\nJust as consumers have learned to seek temporary satisfactionsomething attractive that immediately makes us happy for a momentwe all have become collectors of transient moments in love. Lovers may post their pictures or reveal their intimate confessions of love to the public in a manner of showing off, but lovers always feel insecure about being disposed of, dropped, or interchanged. And like our affection for any other consumer product, after a while, love also fades away.\\nLoving relationships have indeed become liquid.\",\n",
       " '\\nPatan is a historical city situated in Lalitpur District of Nepal, inhabited by the people of Newar community. A remarkable characteristic of this city is its portrayal of religious harmony between Hindus and Buddhists in every aspect of the community. Being born and raised here, I got more and more interested in the city when I started doing my graduate studies in Urban Planning, and the insights have been truly fulfilling.\\nSustainable cities are the pressing need of modern times. City planners use tactics such as zoning, open space allocation, walkability, urban growth boundaries, satellite cities and many more to achieve this, but the way in which the then planners of Patan achieved this is truly worth learning.\\nLet me take you through Patan in the 17th century. To start with, Astamatrika, the eight mother goddesses, and Dashamahavidya, the 10 goddesses, were established to set the boundary for urban expansion. The faith in these places of worship was such that people did not go beyond the perimeter set by the goddesses. This protected the lower fertile agricultural land, while the higher ground was used for settlement. So the perimeter boundary directed the development to be compact, and thus walkable. However, though there was compactness, there were ample urban open spaces and lung spaces (green spaces). Urban open spaces named Lachi, Nani, Bahal  Bahi were preserved and each was tied with its respective religious belief system (Hinduism or Buddhism), such that no one encroached upon it (unlike our open spaces!). For lung spaces named khyo, different festivals and socio-cultural events were planned such that the space would be in constant care. Also, open spaces of ecological importance were tied with various rituals too. The planners then had the vision and the creative methods to protect these open spaces.\\n\\nAstamatrika of Patan (Source: Google Earth)\\n\\nMoving further into the city, the form of residential quarters shows the importance given to communal living. The houses are clustered around an inner courtyard, giving room for private spaces inside houses, while ensuring access to a larger public space for everyone. This model with slight deviations is becoming popular with Western developers too.\\n\\nNewa Chen, a 17th-century building, renovated in 2006 with help from UNESCO\\n\\nIn the case of zoning, it was zoning by jaat or zoning by profession. Though the concept of jaat led to social discrimination, in those days it was primarily used to create homogeneous communities by occupation to create agglomeration and economies of scale. With all this in place, when the population still exceeded a certain limit, a satellite town was established with linkages to the main town, to curb the effects of overpopulation.\\nSo this begs the question, how was this extraordinary feat made possible? Certainly, the planners were quite creative and the tool they used was ritual mediation. The meanings given by the people to these rituals had bound the people. They put tremendous faith in rituals and religion. But now, as with every historic city, Patan is going through the process of degeneration. At times the rituals can be seen to be performed only for the sake of rituals, without paying enough attention to the deeper purpose of sustainability, which they hoped to achieve. This situation has brought forth a new set of challenges, which calls for maximum creative efforts by planners to establish newer meanings. An example could be, the lung spaces mentioned earlier being protected through socio-cultural events might be adjusted by giving access to schools for their events in culture and sports, in case the previous ties grow weaker.\\nHistory serves as a record of experiences and learning, but not as a rule book. It is up to us to learn from the experiences of the past, and come up with creative solutions to tackle the challenges of the present and future.\\nMay the planners of the future write as highly of us as we write about the planners of the past.',\n",
       " \"\\nIn a very odd manner, every possible world tends to exist in ways that are not entirely physical. A world that could be described in words but is devoid of any space-time convergence. Our dreams, for example, don't have any physical run-down. They just appear real to the dreamer and yet leave in a wisp when they are over. The dreamer then is left with the memory of the world that never gets to come alive, the world of zero substance, and the world whose absence is the very reason that gives meaning to the world that gets to live forward.\\nThe nonappearance of every possible version of our other realities makes it possible for this reality to emanate into the physical world that matters to us the most. This is where we find ourselves. This is the one that has its claim on us. Think about the person you didnt marry, the child that wasnt born to you, the winter that failed to bring the snow and the friendship that couldnt find its morning in the dew of little things and didnt get refreshed.\\nIn that sense, all that didnt happen in a life is the very life blood of what did happen in a very bizarre and asymmetrical manner. The relationship between those two worlds is just the fringe line that makes those two worlds mutually coeval. Not just the one that claims me but also the one that I am absent from.\\nThis is the world that I ponder about all the time.This is also where I find myself present in my absence.\\nThose two roads that diverged in the woods and the one Robert Frost didnt take,\\nWhat happened to that road?\\nDid it wither away?\\nOr did it somehow become a critical part of the one that was taken? Frosts grievance about the road not taken makes one wonder what the real loss to him was.\\nThe road that he didnt take is as necessary as the one he did take.\\nFor if it were not for the one untaken, the taken would lose its significance.\\nHowever, unlike Robert Frost, there are moments in life where two roads dont always diverge into the yellow wood. In fact, I only see one road ahead of me. And this one doesnt lead to the yellow wood. Instead, it leads to this huge strip of a green hill. In the midst of that hill, theres a big oak tree. Under it, I see a man waiting for something, or perhaps someone. I dont know.\\nSo, I hesitate for a moment, but then I move towardhim to get closer.\\nThe story of his life is the story of anyones life. He has had his share of lifes ups and downs in this world that claims him in all its hue and tinge. The mans loss of his love, his aspirations, his honor, his will, and all that makes him the hero of his device, all that is taken away.\\nThis is the man who doesnt look straight at me. I cannot clearly see him.\\nHis voice grooved and barely audible, as if he is telling the story of his life to himself. My presence doesn't seem to bother him. He is speaking very softly, and he is speaking of the life he missed to be a part of. This life, the one under the oak, isnt his for him. He is a stranger here.\\nThe life, he thinks, belongs to him is in the negative space. It is the space that can only be imagined or dreamed of. This is where he finds his completions.\\nHis love, his honor, his aspirations, and everything that makes him a whole, it happens in this imagined space.\\nThis is his home, the one built on his absences.\\nNonetheless, he seems not to understand that both these worlds, the one under the oak tree and the one away from it are his to claim.\\nOne subdued in the background while the other bulged out into physical space.\\nBoth these two realms are necessary for this forlorn man to become a whole.\\nTake away one and the other ceases to live.\\nI look at him again, and this time, he looks right back at me.\\nThe man slowly moves as if to talk to me. He leans forward.\\nNow, I see his face in my deepest awe. I know this man!\\nThis is the man from that hill. The man from under the oak tree.\\nI recognize him now. This man is me.\\nI am the man under that oak tree.\",\n",
       " '\\nI can understand when philosopher Slavoj Zizek sees happiness as unethical. For many of us happiness seekers, his assertion may sound rather surprising. However, I think Zizek is right with his claim, if our appetite for maximizing our happiness now impacts ecological collapse, puts the existence of future generations on this planet at a greater risk and also compromises the ability of the future generations to meet their needs without strife and needless sufferings. Besides, in an age of hyperconsumerism, we have placed our habits of happiness on a shallow myth that we cant be happy without having. And, we have mindlessly decided to overlook the bitter truth that many of our happiness choices are detrimental to the ecology and sustainability. Similarly, our search for happiness can be unethical if we stifle and undermine the happiness of others for our selfish fulfillments. We see this in our family life, where most parents add needless sorrows in the lives of their children for not keeping up with their choices, expectations and preferences.\\nMy own search for happiness reminds me that the road I am traveling on is full of potholes. And, by traveling on this bumpy road, I have realized that happiness always appears in our life in unusual shapes, sounds and sizes. Hence, there are little puddles of humor, fun, playfulness and joys everywhere. Moreover, in my search for happiness, I have unearthed some essential ingredients for a happy life.\\nTo live a happy life, firstly, we need to respect and admire others for their unique ways of being in the world. Some like to make noise, others crave silence, and some like to be in front and others like to shout from the back. Hence, rather than comparing people, we need to admire people for who they are, what they have been through and how they like to engage with other people. With this respect we can both increase and improve our human relationships, the way we relate to each other, which is essential for a happy life.\\nThe next ingredient for a happy life is that we need to have enough courage so that we can avoid becoming a chasing shadow of other peoples expectations, projections and desires. Without courage, our life would be nothing more than a tedious circle of compulsions and compromises. And, it also takes enormous courage to be satisfied with who we are and what we have right now.\\nFinally, so much of our happiness depends on our ability to let go of our sense of control. In a world of imperfections, how our life unfolds and how people decide to act and react with us are beyond our absolute control. Hence, rather than holding onto the ropes of our expectations tightly, we need to let go and enjoy what remains of it, the experience of life, with all its random surprises - and thats what happiness is.\\nSources of Happiness\\nThe most important source of happiness in our life is not what we have with us or what we want to have sooner or later, rather, streams of happiness begin to sprout in our life abundantly when we begin to realize that our human life is indeed little and we cant go on postponing our happiness by attaching it to some event, situation or to an achievement that we may never encounter in our short life. None of us have a written script of our life with us and as we strive toward our dreams and possibilities, often the drama of life turns out the way we never suspected.\\nAnd, to find happiness in those messy and confusing moments of our life we need to recognize that patterns of human life are unwritten, uncalled for and unpredictable. Even with our utmost preparedness none of us can systematically dictate the course of our life with our own will. Therefore, in order to live a happy life we need to replace the concept of happiness as a destination with the concept of happiness as a process. After all, so much of the happiness we experience in our life depends on how we react to what is happening in and around us.\\nMost of us are unhappy because we think of happiness in terms of when or how we are going to be happy. Whereas we can create happiness even in difficult situations of our life by remaining resolute in our inner conviction that with whatever we have we can always recreate our life once again. Besides, when we have nothing else to do, even counting what we already have also makes us happy. Despite having many things, many of us are miserable with a single thought of why we dont have with us what the rest of the world already has.\\nHaving is not enough; happiness happens when we do something that makes us feel worthwhile, energetic, focused, connected, purposeful and engaged. For example, we can learn new stuff, develop new habits, cultivate new friends, make life easy for ourselves, let go of expectations that pull us down and sometimes take a step back to see things anew. Moreover, life is not fair and all of us dont need equal things to be equally happy. Our struggles also give us a sense of happiness when we realize that we are maturing as a human being climbing new heights.\\nFinally, I feel that the most precious source of happiness is always cheap, ordinary, plentiful, spontaneous and free. Just the other day, I was witnessing clouds in the sky, which seemed like building tiny steps into eternity, and these clouds floating in the sky made me feel relaxed and fulfilled for a while. I know there is nothing special about clouds playing in the sky. However, all we get in life are the moments to become happy and it depends on how we add these moments to our experiences and make our life a satisfying journey.\\nHappiness: A Journey\\nWhenever I ponder over my quest for a flourishing life, I take the words of poet T.S. Elliot rather seriously as he has written somewhere in one of his poems that, we shall not cease from exploration/and the end of all our exploring/we will arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. In essence, our search for happiness begins with oneself and culminates within oneself. However, in a world of constant distractions, denials, self-deceptions and delusions, for most of us it is rather discomforting to be at ease, comfort or at peace with oneself.\\nAfter witnessing and experiencing various ups and downs in our life and facing up to all the troubles and sorrows that life throws at us from time to time, our search for happiness turns full circle when we realize that the ultimate joy in our life begins to overflow profoundly when we become true to ourselves standing before the mirror of our life, embracing its true reflections and finding freedom within our self. But, the paradox here is that only those who know how to spread out their self find happiness within them. Hence, in our search for happiness we also realize that happiness is not something we experience in isolation and that we derive most of our happiness by connecting with people around us.\\nMoreover, the journey of life takes its own turn and we also need to adopt, adjust and add a sense of growth and maturity with our age as various phases of our life have their own peculiar sources of joy for us to rediscover. Here, for many people their search for happiness becomes delusional, self-destructive and indulgent, when they fail to comprehend this reality of human life. Hence, to experience happiness at different junctures, we need to rephrase and reshape our dreams, hopes, wishes, relationships and expectations, adopting the emerging realities of our life. Besides, as long as we are pursuing happiness, our search becomes like running about from one circle to another trying to find something that exists like a mirage appearing in the dry wilderness; it appears at once and escapes in another moment. And, while journeying on rough and tough roads of our life in search of happiness, often we need to take a pause and shift our mind from the loops of desiring and expecting to life itself where everything is alive and happening.\\nLastly, rather than finding, happiness is just about letting go and losing oneself in the moment with whatever ordinary we have, a piece of music, art, dance, reflection, love, friendship, conversation, meditation , sex, fun or poetry. After all, happiness is always with us, it simply needs a bit of inner tuning and with our sense of ease, acceptance and comfort within oneself, we can catch its vibrations all around us echoing.\\n(Gaurav Ojha is a faculty of communication, critical thinking and business research at different educational institutions.

       " '\\nRabindra Mishras new alliance with the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party, virtually a political arm of the former king, has hogged much of the limelight in recent days. The comfort with which he has gelled with his new companions indicates that Mishra is much more at ease under the former kings patronage than he ever was during his brief, if half-hearted, stint as a republican with the Bibeksheel Sajha Party. The palpable ease with which he has hugged the institution of monarchy shows that he has finally sloughed off his outer skin and has decided to openly and unequivocally put the money where his mouth is. In deciding to abandon his previous nicetiesboth in his ideology as well as his speechMishra has replaced his finger wagging schoolmarmish style, with a metaphorical sledge-hammer and has decided to wield it against the nascent democracy questioning its very foundations.\\nIt is no wonder that Mishra has tapped into a powerful mix of grievances and resentment of the old guard, those who typically were the beneficiaries ofand did well underthe former kings and his predecessors patronage. If the likes and retweets on Twitter are any indication, even those who claim to be a Global Citizen from Gulmi seem to be tacitly endorsing a patently parochial view based on medieval superstitions.\\nThat a child born in a certain family inherently holds a superior position to the rest of us and accordingly has an in-born right to rule as an enlightened guardiansomething that Mishra is advocating foris a notion that would invoke laughter and ridicule if it was not so dangerous and foolish.\\nNow, to his credit, I think Mishra is indirectly and unwittingly serving democracy by holding the banner of opposition against, among other things, the cronyism and kleptocracy of our current leaders. The current crop of leaders are indeed undermining Nepals fledgling democracy by their own incompetence and widespread grift. Our democratic institutions, unfortunately, have not matured enough to curb the excesses of our leaders and a sensible conservatism, I believe, does have an important role to play in the current political climate.\\nHowever, by advocating for the resurrection of a dated institution that has been the provenance of bigotry, arbitrary hierarchy, and authoritarian policies in the past, Mishra is doing nothing more than expressing his frustration against the radical leveling of human dignity that has followed the Maoist Revolution in Nepal.\\nFor all its chaos and cravenness, there is no denying that the Maoist revolution initiated an era of modernity that valued the minorities and indigenous people as human beings with their own individuality and human dignity, something that was denied to them for centuries under the structural discriminations created and sustained under various monarchical regimes.\\nMishras belief that a soft dictator should always hover over the heads of Nepali peopleready to unleash the punitive power of the state at its willnot only belies ignorance of human psychology and its cravings for unlimited power, but, more importantly, is indicative of a limited historical understanding of how democracy functions and delivers.\\nDemocracy, though a rule of the majority, ensures fundamental freedoms and protects the rights of the minorities. It is an inherently messy system which by default favors wheeling and dealing among various political actors instead of dealing in quick fixes along clean and defined lines. Unfortunately the bad tags along with the good in a democracy, and it is one of the vital duties of a politician to see that the good comes out on top. However, men are not angels and therefore democracy requires institutional maturity and independence to hold the political actors accountable whenever they cross the legal and normative boundaries. And those boundaries are set not only by courts and government agencies but also by the society at large. An intelligent politician more attuned to the aspirations of modern times would try to align our Byzantine institutionsthe actual root of our current problemwith the promises enshrined in our current Constitution, however lacking those may be. It is no doubt easier said than done; however, a great leader knows that not everything can be achieved in ones lifetime. A good leader knows that our present should not define our future because politics at heart is about what ought to be rather than what is.\\nInstead Mishra has decided to provoke the latent elements in our society that are atavistic, backward, and superstitious. By surrendering his conscience at the altar of His Highness, Mishra, I believe, is doing a disservice to the ideology of conservatism itself. In his interviews he regularly waxes nostalgic about what we have lost as a culture and community, but rarely does he acknowledge what we have gained as a nation. The laundry list of his complaints are long and consist mainly of the natural consequences that result when a society long held on a chokehold of arbitrary power breaks free. The Nepali people have freed themselves from an arbitrary power that could snatch our freedom at will. We have laid the groundwork for a positive, scientific, and a forward looking country where the minorities and the indigenous have an equal ownership in the nation. It would be a significant backward step to take that away from the people and hand it over to a hereditary power that could potentially pull the plug on our democracy on its whim. Are we really up for that?',\n",
       " \"\\nWhat does the future of humanity look like? Machine learning and artificial intelligence are pushing all kinds of business, innovation, research and other areas to a whole new level, especially in developed countries. The time has come for Nepal to embrace the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to tackle the difficult problems that the country has faced for centuries. Natural disasters, precision agriculture, managing road traffic, environmental sustainability are the perfect candidates for the next technological revolutions.\\nAs a middle school student in America, I have had the privilege of learning programming and machine learning along with theoretical foundations from experts in the field. I invite the girls of Nepal to join me in learning the foundations of data science and machine learning so that we not only help the country to grow with a future army of machine learning experts, but also smooth out the wrinkles of the gender gap in Nepal. It is obvious that one of the most significant steps toward breaking the gender barrier is through empowering girls. Let's make it happen!\\nYour future is powered by code; if you want to build for the future, you'll need to learn how to code. Here, I propose an innovative idea about the most sophisticated tool that is transforming the world right now. I invite the girls of Nepal to join me in learning how to code for predictive analytics and machine learning. My purpose for this call is twofold: first, to contribute to reducing the gender gap, and second, to have fun teaching coding and machine learning.\\nCoding, or computer programming, is a vital tool in science, engineering, business and many other fields that will help you tremendously in achieving your goals. Coding is the language of machine learning and predictive analytics. The developed countries of the world are undergoing a major transformation in their economies thanks to the very powerful algorithms of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). But how does it work?\\nMachine learning is a futuristic idea that has been in the making for quite some time now. It is a set of algorithms that predicts patterns and data on a large scale. Machines are learning how to process vast amounts of data in order to improve our lives in ways we can't even fathom. Machine learning is a set of computer algorithms that learn how to make predictions based on the information provided. With human intelligence, it is difficult to make predictions with datasets that are too large, complex, or vast. In contrast, machines will be able to take the data and make the predictions that humans cannot.\\nTake an example of AlphaGo with which began the global sensation of AI. Designed in 2015, AlphaGo, an AI with unimaginable power, won against the best of the best in the game of Go. The best part is, the designer of AlphaGo has no clue how to play the game.\\nWhereas AlphaGo is an example of a full-blown powerful AI, what I am proposing here is the route to becoming a specialist in various types of predictive analytics and machine learning. Conventionally, AI has been treated as a broad spectrum of techniques that solve a computational task. This can theoretically include many techniques, many of them being not-so-great historically. Machine learning is a suite of powerful statistical models and algorithms that have developed dramatically in these last few decades. These days, when the media talks about AI, they usually refer to a specific version of the ML models called deep learning or its variants.\\nMachine learning is a remarkable set of technologies that can be used for a wide variety of applications. One of the algorithms Ive written is 97% accurate in detecting breast cancer. For this, I used a database of over 11,000 medical records published online. The model I wrote learns to distinguish a case of breast cancer from a healthy breast by comparing many characteristics of breasts afflicted with cancer versus the ones without. Machine learning is the foundation of the future of healthcare. Experts believe that half of the medical discoveries and innovations will come from machine learning in a decade, as opposed to the current heavy reliance on hard-core scientific research as of now.\\nMachine learning algorithms are used for many kinds of applications such as in healthcare, email filtering, speech recognition, computer vision, search engine queries, and many more. The question is, can we create an army of ML experts in Nepal and make a dent in the gender gap with the proper training and mindset?\\nMachine learning, specifically AI driven by the architecture of deep learning model, is transforming the industries of the developed world. Whereas all these achievements sound far-fetched, especially in a developing country like Nepal, they were all achieved with the application of powerful algorithms. For that, all you need is a passion to learn how to code and to learn the theory. I am myself learning machine learning, and have already been able to use some of the machine learning models I have programmed in various predictions. It gives me pleasure when I can teach what I have learnt and help reduce the gender gap at the same time. If you are curious about coding, data engineering and machine learning, join me online in gaining this new knowledge.\\nIn this programming and machine learning course, I will walk you through the basics of programming. This foundational material about scripting is the first step in programming of any type of analytics. And this is going to enrich you with a whole new suite of scripts to perform many essential tasks in analytics. The skills in foundational programming will also come handy when you want to solve many kinds of real-world problems. For example, I like to program and solve problems that come up in college-level probability courses. I am able to do this via programming even when I dont understand the math.\\nI have created a few articles showing several of these problems, their code, and solutions. For example, roll several dice at the same time and if you observe the same number in more than one dice repeatedly, those outcomes can be simulated with the code I published here. In another article here, I show how the chances of two students in a group of 25 having the birthday on the same day are actually pretty high. I have also published my code here to find the probabilities of various kinds of card games. In addition, I simulated the famed Monty Hall Problem to solve the puzzling question as to which choice would help you win the game. The simulation of the situation [available at my GitHub] revealed that the answer was not what I had thought.\\nWhereas you can do many types of problem-solving with the basics of programming like I showed above, the main goal of this first course is to get ready for machine learning. Once the basics of programming are completed, I will walk you through several models of machine learning. If you are interested, sign up today for this free course.

       " '\\nI come from the Chepang community, one of the most backward communities in Nepal and categorized as a highly marginalized community by the National Federation for Development of Indigenous Nationalities (NFDIN). As I belong to and grew up in this community, it motivated me to write a reflective piece on the contributions of education and the bottlenecks for the Chepang community in the current educational pedagogy in Nepal.\\nThe Chepang community falls behind in different socioeconomic indicators such as literacy and access to health and basic infrastructure, as well as in different socioeconomic categorizations. Despite supportfrom several NGOs, INGOs and constant support from the government, the Chepang community continues to remain in a dire situation. There were several non-formal education programs conducted by NGOs which have enabled target groups to become aware so that they can help themselves. Despite the continuous flow of aid, however, the desired socio-economic transformation has not been seen in the Chepang community. This gives ample supporting statement on why there has been less development in the Chepang community. Literacy rate is still low, most of them still live below the poverty line, and they are far behind in the human development index and similar indicators. There are indigenous communities who made a leap in income-generating activities, adult literacy programs, and other development activities. Chepang people, however, still lag behind on all fronts.\\nEvery year thousands of students complete SEE, higher secondary education or bachelors degree out of whom few are from the Chepang community. Despite structural and historical disadvantages, a few Chepangs excel in their academic career. Even after Chepangs are able to complete their education in spite of several hardships, they need to compete with others for Public Service Commission, non-governmental, skills-based and other jobs. Those who are able to receive good schooling are at least exposed to multiple facilities including access to computer learning, libraries and sports, and so might have enriched their general knowledge and have a competitive advantage when applying for jobs. But the ones like students from the Chepang community who mostly completeschool from a place where there are limited facilities, exposure and training, find it difficult to compete with the batch of students with whom they passSEE or high school together. Lack of basic computer skills, training and exposure puts them at a disadvantage in the application process. However, there are a few exceptions where a student who completed schooling from a remote part of the country competed and excelled in many aspects. This gives ample space to reflect on what is holding the Chepang community back  whether it is the current pedagogy or the incompetency within students from the Chepang community.\\n\\nEducation as a means to reproduce inequality for Chepang community\\nIt is clearly seen in Nepal that those who can afford expensive tuition fees, mostly those from economically well-off backgrounds, tend to send their children to private schools, colleges and universities because they think that expensive schools provide quality education.\\nWhen selecting schools and colleges for their children, parents with fat wallets in Nepal take into account the infrastructure of the institution, well-decorated classrooms, transportation, computer labs, swimming pools, basketball courts, football grounds and other facilities. These parents believe that quality education is provided by such schools with proper infrastructure and other facilities. Although it might be a subjective measurement for quality education as indicators, this will make a substantial impact on what students will learn in what environment. Though these may not be good indicators for measurement, what students will learn and how they will learn will certainly make an impact on the overall learning process. And yes, it is certain that students from better economic backgrounds can afford private tutors and attend private schools. Several studies have also found out the positive relations between students economic backgrounds and their test scores. These components contribute to differential academic performance in schools which is directly related to the income of a students family.\\nThe Chepangs, most of whom come from a poor and downtrodden socioeconomic background, cannot generally attend expensive schools unless they are provided scholarships, subsidies and other benefits. So, students from affluent families go to well-off schools while those from poor economic background attend economic schools. These are the initial indicators for students leading to learning disparities that reinforce social inequality. These substantiate that schools provide competitive learning environments to advantaged children compared to disadvantaged children where schools reproduce or exacerbate some inequalities.\\nTo illustrate with a real-life example, I askedmy sister Simran Praja (name changed) who is waiting for her grade 12 results. She is not familiar with what a CV or resume is. She also does not have computer knowledge and skills which are a prerequisite in todays job market. Basic email communication, searching for jobs, applying for jobs and getting shortlisted is a tall order. There are only a handful of Chepang representatives in government services. Hence, preparing for Public Service Commission jobs is also a difficult task although its not impossible.\\nHence, these real-life examples clearly show the challenges faced by Chepang students even after they manage to complete basic schooling, high school and even university education. The quality of education that Chepang students are getting is leading them nowhere. A research on Chepangs in 2011 found out that Chepangs had more access to education than before, but the quality of education that Chepang students were receiving was below average. Though a growing number of students were enrolled in schools, children were now just going through the rituals of schooling rather than learning and preparing for their secure future.\\n\\nEducational journey stymiesChepangs development\\nReflecting on my personal experience of growing up in a Chepang community where there is material deprivation, lack of fulfillment of basic needs and other necessities further deprives the Chepang students of a learning environment. Several studies claim that material deprivation also leads to low educational achievement in schools as students coming from low economic strata tend to lack education materials, environment and parentalguidance throughout. To illustrate with an example, poverty plays a crucial role in Chepang children dropping out of school. Some may not be able to afford an education while some drop out in the middle due to household responsibilities. To support the claim one study states that cultural factors play a significant role in Chepang girls dropping out of school as Chepang people expect girls to help their families with household chores, leaving many girls at home during the harvest season and festivals when their families need their help. The author claims that many girls do not attend classes on a regular basis because of household duties such as cutting grass for animals, cooking food, cleaning and taking care of younger siblings.\\nEven during the recent COVID crisis in Nepal, several students from poor economic backgrounds could not afford to purchase phones and internet data packs which hampered their class attendance. As a result, they could not attend online classes in schools, ultimately leading to many school dropouts in the last two years. Most of the school-going children from the Chepang community had to discontinue their education during the pandemic for lack of internet access, technology and devices, resulting in a large number of dropouts.\\nThese reflections and arguments are also backed up by contributions in sociology by scholarssuch as Luis Althusur, Downey and Condron who claim that education acts as a means for reproduction of ruling class ideology where dominant class ideology is taught. The scholarlyclaims that schools actas engines of inequality dominate contemporary sociology of education even thoughschools play little role in generating achievement gaps.These educational institutions act as a social sorting machine, creating categories that serve as the foundation of later life inequalities. These categories contribute to production of inequalities within schools and beyond.\\nWay forward for Chepangs: Technical education as a ray of hope\\nDevelopment agencies still tend to impose their own agenda rather than fulfilling the requirements of Chepangs. Some of the common instances are awareness activities such as financial frugality, use of contraceptives, use of pit latrine, growing cash crops, forming mothers groups, training on tailoring, youth clubs, and ability to sign ones name. Where is the indigenous knowledge and the prior knowledge that the Chepang community possesses? Why did income-based learning not become a priority for this vulnerable and poor community? Technical and vocational education is gradually gaining popularity in the Chepang community. Technical certified jobs like staff nurse, overseer, electrician, plumber, health assistant are now becoming a way forward for the Chepang community. There are growing numbers of staff nurses who are already in local level health posts on government contracts. These small steps also play a key role in helping the Chepang community support their families, siblings in accessing education and other opportunities.\\nAs most of the Chepang people are below the poverty line, the government needs to give priority to creating more employment opportunities so that everyone can get work. Given that a majority of youths from the community are less educated and have dropped out halfway through school, the country needs to train and mobilize them in the development process. Productivity-focused training skills, recognizing prior learning of Chepangs should be imparted with inclusive targeting to the Chepang community which can provide access to work. This entire process not only helps the countrys economy to grow but also enables the Chepang youths to earn their livelihoods.\\n(The authoris currently pursuing M Phil at Kathmandu University School of Education)',\n",
       " '\\nAs I sit by my ailing father, I have an impression of him representing an era of slowly vanishing Limbu culture and tradition of Mundhum-based rites and rituals.\\nI still vividly remember how vehemently he performed the ritual of Tongsing Takma as a Yeba (Limbu shaman assigned for carrying out various rituals) some decades ago. In the night of the ritual performance, he would wear long white robe tightened at the waist, a headdress decorated with the feathers of different birds and garlands made from the beads of rudraksha. For the whole night, he would recite Mundhum and dance around the bamboo pole known as Yagesing fixed for the ritual in the middle of the courtyard. As a boy, I could hardly grasp the eloquence of his Mundhum recitation and message of those rich oral scriptures. For me, the event was simply an occasion of celebration and fun where I enjoyed ludicrously following and copying his dancing steps and panicked and thrilled being chased by him in the middle of the ritual performance along with others.\\nBack then, Limbu community operated differently. They observed their own distinct life rituals including Tongsing Takma. The night of Tongsing Takma was not only an event for ritual performance but it was also a social gathering for the entire villagers. Some of them would come to join hands for the different responsibilities including feeding Tongba (millet beer served in a wooden barrel shaped vessel) and other local liquor to the visitors while others would come to know their fortune from the words of the Yeba, my father. Others joined the Yeba and his Yagapsiba (assistant of the Yeba) in the ritual dance carrying and beating brass plates. For majority of villagers, it was a pure form of an entertainment free of invitation. Everyone was welcomed in the night of the Tongsing Takma ritual.\\nThe decade of 1990 ushered prodigious changes in Nepali politics as well as in sociocultural realms. The Janaandolanof 1990 saw an end of absolute monarchyreplaced byconstitutional monarchy and multiparty system ending three decades of party-less Panchayatsystem imposed by King Mahendra in 1960. The same decade also worked as a harbinger for the country embracing neoliberal ideals as the panacea for socio-economical transformation. Nobody thought of far-reaching implications of the incipient systems to the local language, culture, knowledge system and social structures of the indigenous people.\\nSame applied to the Limbu people, chiefly inhabiting the eastern part of Nepal. In addition to joining British and Indian armies as Lahure, many Limbu youths followed the footsteps of other Nepali migrant workers making destinations mainly to Malaysia and the Gulf Cooperative Council countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait among others. As foreign employment became a major source of income for many a Nepali households in the last three decades, it further provided an impetus for people to migrate from the hills and mountains to the plain regions of Tarai and from rural villages to city and towns, thus bringing unprecedented changes in rubrics of society and culture.\\nSuch migration trends not only resulted in the shortage of working age people in the villages but also brought changes in demographic and economic structures of towns and countryside leaving the family members of migrant workers increasingly dependent on the remittance they send from abroad. Accordingly, people fell under the charm of consumerism ultimately debilitating the bonds of social relationship and cultural convictions of the indigenous people. As everybody seemed lost in the reservoirs of containment by hailing the contribution of Nepali migrant workers to the economic development of Nepal, nobody seemed cognizant of the disconcerting side of the coin, the breakdown in the family structures and cultural mosaics. The void was not only created in the local labor markets, but also in the urgency of indigenous cultural behaviors and ritual practices.\\nIn the past, my father used to remain busy throughout the year serving the village households as Yeba, performing different rituals of Limbu community like Sappok Chomen (ritual for womb worshipping prior to birth), Mangenna (ritual for good health, peace and progress), Mekkhim (ritual for marriage ceremony) etc. Due to his engagement in such activities of the community, I sometimes used to hear him complaining about not having time for his own household chores as a farmer. But he readily served the community on such occasions. I still remember how my father used to take pride in his narratives of being kidnapped by a supernatural wild shaman in his childhood who taught him the sacred knowledge of Mundhum and turned himself a self learnt Yeba, as one of the chosen persons by the God to save Limbu community from the various misfortunes and sickness. Gradually, my father and fellow Limbu shamans commonly called as Phedangma, Samba, Yeba and Yuma not only found their roles being drastically limited within the community, but they also failed to pass their knowledge to the next generation.\\nHermeneutics of Tongsing Mundhum\\nAccording to Mundhum scholar Bairagi Kaila, Tongsing Mundhum is an extreme expression of social, ethical and religious beliefs of Limbu people. He writes in Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Aakhyan Ra Anusthan (Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Narratives and Rituals) that Tongsing Mundhum is a quintessential collection of oral literature and ethnic narratives that have been transferred orally from the time immemorial to the Limbu people. This Mundhum is recited and narrated along with music of brass plates and drums by Limbu shamans known as Samba, Yeba, and Yema during the performances of Tongsing Takma ritual. It is believed that Tongsing Mundhum was originated long before the art of writing was introduced.\\nAccording to scholar Chaintanya Subba, various myths, legends, narratives and oracles have been incorporated in Tongsing Mundhum which guide the social, ethical and religious concepts and shape the attitude and behavior of the Limbus. It consists of the various myths related to the origin of universe, human beings, plants and animals, and birth of the concepts of incest, jealousy, curse etc. in human society and the remedies for different problems in the society.\\nLimbus believe that there have been substantial influences of the Tongsing Mundhum in the customs, ideologies, moral values and life rituals of the Limbu community. It has a distinct pragmatic and instructional value with regards to the construction and continuation of various social practices and belief system in the Limbu community. It has played a crucial role in imparting the message of social solidarity and cooperation. However, there remains an effectual task for us to explore the social dimensions of Tongsing Takma ritual impacting the social life and practices of Limbus in the past.\\nModernization has resulted into an irreversible loss of Limbu cultural heritages and ritual practices. A handful of enthusiasts of Limbu community are in disagreement themselves on which terminology best describes Limbu religion and cultural landscapes. Each group claims its own validity over the other but ironically overlooks the urgency of passing the knowledge to the coming generation. They dont realize that culture and rituals live in society, not in institutions and books. If such cultural values can not be transferred to the coming generation, they would be the matter of history, to be searched in anthologies and museums. We certainly do not want that. So, rather than castigating others, we need to explore the nostrums to address the present challenges.\\nAs the majority of young generation are detached from such ritual practices, an irreparable cultural void is being created every day. Incipient danger is that present generation could be the last generation of Limbu community practicing and living with the distinct cultural practices and Mundhum-based life rituals. As remaining Phedangma, Samba, Yeba and Yuma have failed to transfer their knowledge to the young generation, it would be very hard to find their disciples practicing these rituals through the oral recitation of Mundhum after one or two decades. Dont get me wrong. I dont want this to happen either. But I have not seen any other possibility too until we carry the torch of responsibility to stand as bulwarks to protect and preserve our distinctive cultural traits before they are pushed into oblivion by the varieties of intrusions.\\nToday, Tongsing Takma and other rituals have become rare events in Limbu community due to two main reasons: first, very few Limbu Phedangma, Samba, Yeba, and Yema are left in the community who can perform them in a proper way and second, young generation have no inclination to follow these rituals as they are gradually losing interest in the past ideals. This is not simply the fault of young generation living under the overwhelming fluctuations of information and technology. We must take responsibility for not infusing them cultural consciousness and not persuading them to adopt these value systems in everyday life.\\nNowadays, a very few households are conducting Tongsing Takma and other rituals as a part of their daily lives mostly in remote villages. Some enthusiastic individuals and institutions are conducting this ritual in Kathmandu and other towns too. But such events largely become a simulacrum of the real Tongsing Takma, more as a frail attempt to recreate it and less as a distinct life rituals of the Limbu community. Such formalized occasions cannot persuade the heuristic value of these rituals to the coming generations.\\nThe only positive sign in this area is there have been some works in the transcribing the oral scriptures of Mundhum recited by those Limbu shamans. In recent days, some Limbu scholars and writers have transcribed Mundhum in Limbu and Nepali language and have documented those ritual performances. In this direction, the colossus work of Mundhum expert Bairagi Kaila is always commendable. He has collected and transcribed most of the Mundhum with the help of Limbu Phedangma, Samba, Yeba, and Yema. I personally feel indebted to his huge contribution to the Limbu community by preserving Limbu Mundhum.\\nYears ago, in the night of the Tongsing Takma ritual, my father used to recite Mundhum and its myths in a rhythmic tone from his infallible memory followed by rhythmic beating of his brass plate and harmonious shamanic dancing steps. In the morning, he would perform the ritual of Silam Sakma (blocking the path of death) for the whole family concerned by reciting the Mundhum as:\\nA bright place due to the moon above us\\nA bright place due to the sun above us\\nIn the place of life and age \\nAre life and age decreasing?\\nAre the bells of time and death ringing?\\nNow, without letting the death bell ring\\nI toss this incanted coin \\nTo block the path of the death.\\n(Excerpts translated from the Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Aakhyan Ra Anusthan by Bairagi Kaila)\\nWith these words, he would toss the coin in the name of each family member until the intended side of the coin overturned in the ground. The turning of the expected side of the coin is believed to have blocked the path of death, as a part of the ritual. I do not claim the efficacy of this ritual in the real time, but the psychological and mental asset of such rituals were certainly an important part of the community in past.\\nOnce ardent practitioner of Mundhum based rituals, my father would spend hours discussing about Mundhum and its various myths deciphering their meaning and implications to us. He adored Mundhum as a treasure for Limbu community that teaches us to live in harmony with nature. He used to say all natural entities be it rivers, hills, caves, forests, or anything that we get from nature, have to be worshiped and preserved because they support human life in one way or the other. He was not being philosophical at that time, neither had he had any idea of the subject but he was simply passing his impression of Mundhum for our generation. Today, I feel that humankind have already deferred the deadline to respect the nature, by exploiting its resources to the fullest extent and wreaking an unprecedented havoc in its beauty. And obviously, we are getting paid by the effects of global warming and other disastrous natural phenomena for our irresponsible action towards nature threatening the existence of life in the blue planet.\\nEven though we listened to his stories enthusiastically, my father could figure out that his listeners were losing interests in them. Then his remarks would be same as always - time has changedin our timeand so on. At this moment, I can sense the meaning of his words but the time has changed for me too. But what I fear most is I even may not have the same words to convey to my children by referring to the nostalgia of our time. The indispensable cultural values that \\u200b\\u200bwe have inherited from our ancestors have been eroding with the passage of time. We are living in an age of cultural deviation and oblivion. Now, when I sit by my ailing father living in his early eighties, I sometimes envisage him as Truganini (1812 1876) the last full blood Aboriginal Tasmanian, whose culture and identity were completely swept away by the wave of 19th century colonialism.',\n",
       " \"\\nThe Summer of 2005 was my first birthday and no guests visited. There was a cake and a toy.\\nThe toy was a helicopter with a broken wing that didnt turn-on or chuff. I always wondered why it was like that.\\nAlso, to bear in mind, my parents emigrated from Nepal when I was seven months old. I was too small, too chubby, and too witless to contribute to their struggle except for the grins and the giggles that made it easier for them to move on with their days.\\nNot until sophomore year in high school did I learn how much my parents had struggled during the early years in the US. I also found the helicopter didnt run, only because my parents couldnt afford a toy during that time. So, they rummaged that broken chopper from someone elses trash.\\nNonetheless, my intent in this narrative is not to inspire any sympathy. For me, this story is not as somber as it sounds. In fact, I got an opportunity to understand my parents struggle with a newfound humility. Their story and their sacrifice helped me get through a struggle, even if minor, was all my own.\\nSomewhere around the same time I was in high school, and nothing was going well. More importantly, I could not seem to get faster running cross-country. I had always loved running since early on, but at that point, the sport felt more like an obligation than a passion. I strove for motivation but failed to find one. At the heart of this disquietude, I knew the slip-up was only because without a clear plan, I just was not driven.\\nAs fate would have it, one morning in September of 2019, while I was struggling to run at the practice, Jaclyn, one of my faster running mates, asked me to run with her. I refused at first because I knew I couldn't keep up with her and yet, for some reason, I decided to plug away. That day, I called out on whatever was holding me back and I ran with her. I ran for myself and for my parents, and I ran to be the best version of my possibility.\\nThis gave me confidence and made me realize that I could accomplish what I thought was unimaginable. I realized my doubts and insecurities stemmed from my failure to push myself outside my comfort zone and that merely wanting something is not enough. I also had to act on it!\\nAfter that day, I proactively began creating a routine that I consistently followed. Just in a few weeks, I started seeing improvements.\\nAside from the track, I also got in touch with a few friends from Nepal and created a think tank named The Connectors. The goal of this group was to support Nepals diplomacy with the other countries, especially its neighbors like India, China, and Bangladesh.\\nI became one of the senior captains in the Colleyville Heritage High School Cross-Country team. We qualified for the state three years consecutively and our team finished fourth among 5A Schools in Texas during the 2021 season. Meanwhile, I also frequently volunteer by visiting the middle school runners to motivate and encourage them.\\nI often think about that moment in my sophomore year where something snapped into the place, and I began to turn my life around. Some part of me believes that moment is defined by my friends lending hand while the other part is the inspiration from my parents' adversities.\\nNietzsche once said, 'A person with a Why can bear any How or What.'\\nThat forlorn summer morning, that dwindling moment of despair and gratitude, when those hapless hands picked that toy, thats where I found my Why.\\nThe lowest moment my dad and my mom endured to give me a wisp of joy is now my highest moment to give them theirs back.\\n(Rijal is currently studying at Colleyville Heritage High School, Texas)\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nFor a very long time we have been hearing the governments intention to regulate the over the top (OTT) and other services providing internet content in Nepal. Well, the wait is over as the government has recently come up with the amendment in the National Broadcasting Regulation 1995 (2052).\\nThe 11th amendment of the regulation has included OTT, video on demand (VOD), and internet television under 'Other Means of Communications'. With the said inclusion, the regulation now requires OTT and internet television to register to provide its service in Nepal. The term OTT has been defined as the service of displaying the programs as per the demand of the consumer through the internet without using the means of direct to home (DTH) cable or satellite and such term shall also include the media streaming services through other platforms by the means of internet. Further, internet television (Internet TV) has included the regular act of transmission of the self-produced audio-visual programs through the internet.\\nThis definition will require popular streaming service providers like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. to obtain approval from the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. The regulation has further provisioned for the mandatory requirement of the cache server within Nepal if the OTT service provider intends to make any member or customer in Nepal or acquire any kind of fees from Nepal. It has also required the storage of user information within the server of Nepal. Further, the OTT service providers should keep a record of the programs transmitted by them, for at least 60 days and the same shall also be made accessible to the ministry and other governmental authorities in the process of investigations.\\nThe content to be displayed through OTT must also be subject to categorization as per age. The U rating must be granted for such content which is appropriate to all the age groups whereas A rating is provided to the content for the age group above 18 years. R rating, similarly, provided to the content appropriate to the age group of 10-18 years.\\nThe regulation also provisions that the ministry can take control of such equipment or make necessary arrangements to disallow the operation of such equipment which has been used for transmission or communication of the program in an unauthorized manner without obtaining necessary license or approval as required by the regulation.\\nAs the regulation has mandatorily required approval of the ministry in order to distribute the content through the internet in Nepal, it is worth observing to see whether the foreign companies providing such services to the users based in Nepal comply. Due to the limited market of users in Nepal, it is less likely the service providers would be willing to register in Nepal as it may also trigger other compliance requirement as per the laws of Nepal. Further, it would be important to see what the governments next step would be as the regulation is silent on the time period to comply with such requirements and what would it do to foreign OTT service providers if they fail to comply with the licensing requirement of the regulation.\",\n",
       " '\\nI was first introduced to Panauti by John Sanday, the British conservation architect, who was in charge in the 1970s of the restoration of Hanuman Dhoka palace at the center of Kathmandu by UNESCO and has resided in the Nepali capital from that time on.\\nIt was in 1976. I was already familiar with Nepal and the Kathmandu Valley. I had been the cultural attach at the French Embassy in 1970-71, and afterward spent nearly one year in the remote Newar village of Pyangaun in Lalitpur district, a village inhabited by Jyapu paddy-cultivators. These farmers were also at that time makers of bamboo boxes for measuring grains (rice, wheat), pyang in Nepal Bhasha. They used to exchange these boxes against food grains at several localities of the Kathmandu Valley in winter. Subsequently, I prepared and passed a PhD dissertation in the field of social anthropology (Paris University) on that village and joined the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the main public organization for research in France, in 1975. I had learned local languages with students and teachers and was quite fluent at that time in Newari.\\nI remember very well my first time in Panauti with John Sanday. We were looking for a house to rent. The authorities of the locality guided us toward a Karmacharya family inhabiting in the lower part of the town, toward the sacred confluence of the Rosi and Punyamati rivers. The gharpatini, mistress of the house, and her daughter welcomed us. They offered us some food with very strong ayela (rice alcohol) and rented me a house nearby, with a very nice view of Indreshwar Mahadev temple and the Jangam math, the religious establishment where the priests of the Shaivite three-storied temple were inhabiting. The ground floor was used by a health post and a small vegetable garden was attached. It was an ideal place to work. It was decided that three young French architects would join me to undertake a full basic research work on Panauti. During our common period of fieldwork, we would focus on space and architecture. One of these architects, Vincent Barr, was already my friend. He came some years before to Pyangaun to help me draw a map of the village.\\nI moved to Panauti in the rainy season. I came on foot from Godavari with my cook and porter Sarkiman, crossing the range and descending on the other side of the mountain. We didnt know the way exactly and got lost in the clouds. It was raining. We had to spend a night on the way in a Tamang house. We arrived at our destination the next morning. My three friends, who came by bus from Kathmandu the day before, were already there. We started the work immediately. Some inhabitants from Panauti joined us to draw a detailed map of the locality, which at that time didnt exist. We set up three teams with local people for this topographical survey. It took us about 10 days to complete the preliminary job with double decameter ropes. All corners of the city were mapped. It must be said that from the very beginning Panauti inhabitants proved to be very friendly and cooperative with us. This assistance continued in all phases of the research. Perhaps they guessed that their locality would derive some benefits out of this research.\\nThis happened to be true: some years later, in the 1990s, the cultural branch of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs started renovating the main temples of the city, that were in a sorry condition, under the supervision of the Nepali Department of Archaeology. Several other projects focused on more secular matters, especially schools, platforms alongside the streets and an underground pipe system were also launched and implemented. In addition, some grants were allocated to the local youths in the field of technology. Robert Le Foll, a former member of the French Parliament, has been very active in this regard. Panauti became a symbol of French and Nepali cooperation.\\nThree persons from Panauti collaborated with us in a very important and fruitful manner: Ananta Madhikarmi, Chandeshwari Buddhacharya (Shakya), Shiva Jangam, who at the time was the priest of Indreshwar Mahadev temple, and Bisunath Tamrakar. I remember that I surveyed with Ananta Madhikarmi all the houses of the small city, collecting data on the population, as well as on economic data of every family, for instance the surface area (in ropani) of their paddy-fields whether privately owned or just labored as tenants. The French architects stayed for about three months in Panauti and went back to Paris where they were running a private architect enterprise. For my own part, I concentrated the following years almost entirely on Panauti city, its social and religious organization. My rented house was very convenient. I could invite some guests and friends from Kathmandu for lunch or for the weekend. It was also an appropriate place to work with my different local informants and offer them some tea. During the daytime, I used to spend time in the various tea stalls discussing with people on different subjects. And every night, I took a tour of the city along the river and within the market area. I made fantastic day trips with Ananta in the surrounding villages and religious places.\\nAltogether, I spent nearly one year on the spot, from 1977 till 1980. At the end, I offered a bhoj (a feast) to all the persons, Newars and Jangams mostly, who worked with me in the community. I had to sacrifice a goat to the nearby Ganesh on that occasion. Afterward, I presented my ethnographical materials in the Paris University in 1982 and obtained a second more elaborate PhD, after the first one obtained thanks to my study of Pyangaun. We call this superior type of Doctorate Doctorat dEtat in French (this type of Doctorate disappeared from the university courses a little later). With the French architects, our common book written in French language was finally published in 1981 in Paris: Panauti, uneville au Npal (Panauti, a Town in Nepal). It is focused on history, social organization, use of space, domestic and religious architecture. A facsimile edition has been published recently in Kathmandu by Vajra Publications. Unfortunately, this book has not yet been translated in English or Nepali.\\nIn 1976, Panauti, a multi-caste locality, counted around 2,900 inhabitants, among which the vast majority were Newars (97%). It was a small historic city with an important market hub and a great number of pasals (shops) where the surrounding villagers could buy nearly all the items they needed. The market extension at the entrance of the locality, near the Maneshwari (Varahi) temple, already existed in its primary form. It developed dramatically in the following years, destabilizing the life of the small city and redirecting the market activities from the center to the periphery.\\nIn my views, the small town of Panauti can be analyzed through two main different paradigms: the mandalic (or cosmological) model and the socioeconomic change paradigm. I had already recently published a book with a number of photographs on the second aspect: Panauti: Past and present (1976-2020). Let me focus here on the mandalic structure.\\nAt first, the triangular shape of the city is clear. Panauti lies at the confluence of two rivers: the Punyamati to the north, and the Rosikhola to the south. The top of the triangle is pointed to the east. It is believed that a third riversubterranean, invisible riversupposedly flowing from the north under the Brahmayani three-storied temple, meets there. This third hidden river conveys a high sacral aura to the spot. The ritual place, called triveni (confluence of three rivers), is located at this junction and contains many religious monuments. This important religious confluence is visited by religious people every morning and evening. The inhabitants of the surrounding villages come there for cremation.\\nThis triveni confluence gives to Panauti the status of a famous pilgrimage site, known all over central Nepal and even in Northern India. Every 12 years, the Makar Mela (fair) is celebrated on that very place, in the solar month of Magh (January-February). On that occasion, thousands of pilgrims wash away their sins by bathing at the confluence of the three rivers. I described this festival in a long article published 10 years ago in a volume called Sin and Sinners (Brill, 2012). According to the inhabitants, the city has a form of a fish. The main temple of Indreshwar Mahadev, originally built in the 13th century by a Newar princess named Birma Devi and run by Jangam (Lingayat) priests, is related to this religious confluence. The outer impressive struts, which decorate the religious monument with eminent figures of Hindu mythology, are a testimony of the antiquity of the temple. In 1977, we asked the children of Panauti to draw a map of their city, as they imagined. All represented their locality in a triangular form, the triveni oriented upward, to the north, giving to the city the form of a mountain (except one who placed the apex of the triangle downward).\\nYet, this structure is not enough to understand the city. In the 1970s, the urban zone of Panauti was still clearly separated from the outside by an outer circle of eight goddesses temples, dedicated to the Ashta (eight) Matrika of the Hindu-Buddhist Tantric tradition. A specific direction in space corresponds to each of these goddesses. They protect the city against diseases and evil spirits and are regularly worshipped on specific days of the lunar calendar. The temple of Brahmayani, is the most important of these religious monuments. It faces the confluence of the rivers, on the opposite bank of the city.\\nThis outer religious ring is centered on a large esplanade located at the epicenter of the old city, which is called layku, royal palace, by the local people. Located nearby, a small altar is dedicated to the ancient divinity and guardian deity of the Newar Malla kings, the Taleju goddess. Offerings are made there every year, during Dashain festival (mostly in October). This zone is presently under archaeological investigation by the Nepali Department of Archaeology. As a matter of fact, during a temporary period of the medieval age, Panauti had been the seat of a small independent or semi-independent kingdom/principality. In addition, as all Newar settlements, Panauti is divided between an upper part (thane) and a lower part, (kwane) according to the direction for the nearby river. This division passes through the royal center of the city.\\nThis geometrical spatial structure, a center surrounded by eight temples supposedly located in the eight directions of the universe, gives to Panauti the form of a mandala religious diagram, a micro-representation of the universe. The Karmacharyas who are presently the Tantric priests of these goddesses sanctuaries, still have a clear vision of this cosmic configuration. It was applied to Panauti during the Malla medieval time to convey to the locality a royal status and to give her a prestigious microcosmic image of the universe. In this regard, Panauti can be considered as a reduced form of the neighboring larger Hindu city of Bhaktapur, where the German researchers (Klver and Gutschow) have uncovered a similar layout, associated with identical religious representations. As I showed in my research works, the mandalic structure of the city still dominates the religious life of Panauti and comes in full light during the main religious festival celebrated there, particularly during Dashain celebrations and the main jatra (festival, procession) of the city, in the month of May, just before the rainy season: the Jyaa Punhi festival.\\n(The author is Emeritus Research Director at CNRS)',\n",

       " '\\nI want to preface this blog by clarifying that what I am positing here is not an attack on anybodys personal integrity but an attempt to reveal a tendency, perhaps all too human, that often underpins our political biases and colors our vision in such a way that we lose sight of the future.\\nThe political bias I am going to describe here is something that I prefer to call as the bias of the present, or, in other words, the tendency to view current political climate as though it is going to continue as it is forever in the future. Adam Gopnik, a popular writer for the US-based magazine, The New Yorker, calls it presentism, which he defines as, an assumption that what is happening now is going to keep on happening, without anything happening to stop it. I prefer to use the word bias because of the unreasonable prejudice attached to this kind of thinking.\\nThis kind of bias in thinking is now famously attributed to Francis Fukuyama, the renowned political thinker, who, at one time, declared that the world had come to an end of history with liberal capitalist democracies being the climactic endpoint. Fukuyama, who is still pilloried for his rather Panglossian view, argued that countries all over the world were becoming more freer, more liberal, more tolerant, and getting closer and closer to a utopia very similar to the liberal democracies in the West. Fukuyamas grand utterances are seen today as a cautionaryand an instructivemoment for public intellectuals who are inclined to make sweeping claims about the future by simply looking at the current trends.\\nSadly, the current Bibeksheel Sajha Party (BSP), which was supposed to represent the optimism of the youths in the country, seems to be doing a Fukuyama in reverse. Rabindra Mishra and his like-minded coterie in the current BSP formed after the recent purges, are engaged in an overly pessimistic portrayal of present Nepal and have accordingly projected a pessimistic future for the country as though the situation can only get worse from here. Under Mishra, the current BSP apparatus seems almost eager to see the current situation spiral out of control so that their egos will be satisfied, and their recently espoused political lines, vindicated. But in so doing, Mishra and the BSP have not only led the movement of the youths astray but have also muddled the public perception by overestimating their own power while underestimating the fundamental feature of a democracy, namely its auto-correctional tendencies.\\nIn the past BSP was popular among the youths because the party embodied the hopes and optimism that can only spring from the resourceful idealism and energy of the young people. No one expected BSP to form a viable alternative to the prevailing political parties, but everyone took pleasure from the fact that the youths were raising the consciousness of the public by demanding accountability from public officials and showing a new possibility for the future. Alongside the civil society, BSP stood at a sweet spot (call it the Goldilocks of Nepali politics), just outside the fray of everyday politics, but also within it in such a way that it could act both as a party, demanding accountability and good governance, but also as an idealisticentity that projected an optimistic and much-needed normative framework for the future of the countrys politics. The party was extremely successful given its limited reach and resources. The demonstrations against Nepal Banda, in particular, became a huge success while the party also gained enormous support in its fight against government corruption and incompetency, especially in the demonstrations against increasing instances of rapes and sexual assaults around the country.\\nThe party was doing exactly what it was supposed to do until Mishra woke up one morning and blindsided his own party memberswho had sacrificed their youthful energy, time, and resourcesby highjacking the party and free riding on its goodwill. An idealistic party that represented hope for the future was overnight turned into an in-group that delighted in the same muck that it was supposed to transcend.\\nNow, there is no doubt that Rabindra Mishra is a gentleman who is genuinely worried about the current state of affairs in the country. In fact, as someone who is extremely self-aware of his public persona, Mishra, in my opinion, is willing to maintain a level of honesty and transparency that has not yet been seen from any of our leaders. There is no doubt in his honest endeavors. However, a nice coiffeur and a bright persona can only take you so far when the political line you have chosen depends on painting a dark picture. Mishra has, either wittingly or unwittingly, narrowed the imagination of the youths in the country by taking their movement to a dead end. He has done a great disservice by putting his ego before the ethos of the youths.\\nMost importantly though, Mishra and the current BSP are omitting a fundamental difference between the current political systemhowever flawedthat we have versus the system that they are advocating for: the system that we currently have has an inbuilt feature that will slowly but effectively autocorrect its mistakes, while the system that the current BSP is advocating for has an inbuilt bug that will only rear its ugly head again and again.\\nLike many others, I looked at BSP as a party of youths who were not beholden to any established political power. Despite its limited clout, the party was able to transcend the filth of Nepali politics and demand accountability by galvanizing the youths who brought new energy, vision, and optimism to an otherwise ossified party culture in Nepal. Just as the Nepali people were only beginning to believe and share the idealism of the youths, the bias of the present took over BSP and brought the project to a screeching halt.',\n",

       " '\\nAs someone steeped in liberal values it certainly feels odd and slightly uneasy to defend a leader who carriedor perhaps still carriesa huge baggage of totalitarian ideology that is antithetical to my own political beliefs. Despite the deep-seated cognitive dissonance, however, I am making a pitch for a liberal Prachanda not because I condone his actions as a supremo of the armed uprising, but because I think his political survival is necessary for a progressive and forward-looking Nepal that is focused on the principles of individual rights and dignity. Despite his personal and political flaws, which he himself has openly acknowledged on several occasionsa rare instance among Nepali politicians or any politicians for that matterI believe that Prachanda has been a force who has championed the liberal cause in Nepal. At a time when zealotry is rearing its head and the moderates are hobbled by their own incompetency and lack of leadership, Prachandas political survival has become indispensable to prevent the country from sliding backwards from its social and political gains.\\nEven as the country continues to wobble under the weight of egotistical power jockeying of a few politicians (including Prachanda), there has in fact been some significant progress in matters of individual rights, minority rights and their access to justice in the past few years. For all its destruction, any reasonable person who is not driven by personal agendas, will agree that the Maoist Revolution empowered the section of the population that had heretofore been relegated to live as second-class citizens. It is safe to say that the Maoist uprising threw away the yoke of arbitrary customs and traditions that had kept the minorities in positions of permanent subservience and has compelled the hitherto Kathmandu-centric governments to pay attention to broader Nepal, beyond the metropolis. To be sure, the Maoists opened the floodgates for both the good and the bad, and there is no doubt that Prachandas earlier misgivings toward the multiparty democratic system weakened both his political standing as well as peoples trust in the newly established system. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the progressive political achievements are now under attack as some political opportunists try to roll back the clock by undermining every liberal valuefrom secularism to constitutionalism to republicanism.\\nIt is in this context I believe that Nepal needs a liberal Prachanda more than ever. Not the self-serving Prachanda confined to his doctrinal ideology who is always on the lookout for opportunities to burnish his personal image, but a Prachanda who speaks to and champions the needs of the poor, the marginalized and the vulnerable. Nepal needs a Prachanda who consistently keeps the interest of the vulnerable and the marginalized at the front and center of his politics and is guided by a moral imperative to do good for those who have been wronged in the name of caste, creed, geography, or economic status. Nepal needs a liberal Prachanda who doesnt engage in an unwarranted nationalistic jingoism, who doesnt make over-the-top ridiculous claims, who doesnt engage in short-sighted tactical power brokerage, but a Prachanda who is less a politician than a moral character who transcendsor at least tries to transcendpartisan politics. Nepal needs a Prachanda who isnt afraid to lose elections, but nevertheless finds ways to champion the causes of the less privileged. Nepal needs a Prachanda who is chastised by his past mistakes, who isnt hungry for power, who is ready to forgo the limelight, and who understands that he doesnt always have to be at the center of power and politics to do good.\\nPerhaps I might be asking too much from Prachanda, for how can Prachanda live without being Prachanda, a leader who shot to power by brute force of the gun? How can the man, the rebel, and the commander abandon his core ideology that revolves around power grabbing and gaining control of the state? The road ahead may be difficult, but it is doable. The name Prachanda now needs a complete makeover as does the character behind the name. Prachanda needs to start a revolution once again, but this time the revolution should be internal, within himself, and the guiding principles of that revolution should be morality, equality, and justice. Nepal doesnt necessarily need a Prachanda in power, but it needs the voice of a liberal Prachanda who can lead a moral revolution toward an open, tolerant, kind, and just Nepal.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nMenstruation is a part of the reproductive cycle; it is as natural as any secretion that your body discharges. It is a monthly reality for billions of women and girls around the globe. A natural biological process, which should dignify women and girls, has become a subject of shame due to taboos and myths that exclude women from many aspects of socio-cultural life. Despite the advancement in societal understanding, identifying menstruation as impure is still deeply embedded in religion, cultural belongings, and societal practices.\\nNepali society is also prey to the regressive mindset and social practice regarding menstruation. The taboo of vaginal discharge has put women at the back in society all through ages. From religious texts like Swasthanikatha, to story of Rishi Panchami all exemplify how menstruation is a sin and how women are victims of this natural process. The story of Rishi Panchami follows a woman named Sushila who entered the kitchen while menstruating during her past life. This was her biggest sin, and due to which she was reborn as a dog to be treated like one. Her husband in return is also reincarnated as a bull carrying the sin of his wife. The heartrending part is, we as Hindus glorify these myths and perform a yearly ritual on Rishi Panchami just to wash our sin of menstruating away. When we hear these myths we wonder, if goddesses Parvati, Laxmi, Saraswoti, Kali, Durga ever menstruated? If they did, how come they are prayed throughout the year, even during that time of the month?\\nNepali societies in the past have exaggerated the myth surrounding menstruation and have twisted their own product of what menstruation shall actually be. Followed by a lot of donts: dont sit there, dont touch that, dont enter the kitchen, dont touch water source, dont sleep in the bed, dont wear the same clothes, dont stay in the home and whole bunch of donts follows. Such taboos about menstruation present in many societies impact girls and women\\'s emotional state, mentality and lifestyle, and most importantly, health. A lot of these superstitions are behavioral restrictions that, aside from being untrue, contribute to gender-based discrimination. Every adolescent girl has to miss her school and every woman has to sacrifice social functions, festivals, and daily life only because she is born to be the carrier of life. These donts have taken the lives of many women, in the form of Chhau (shed for menstruating women) or unhealthy menstruating practices. Yet, we claim that women are treated as equal in our society. How unfortunate!\\nThe mentality of impure and untouchable has transcended from rural villages to posh educated families of suburban and urban cities of Nepal. Its an embarrassment that highly educated families like ours are still practicing this taboo inflicted by our regressive society. Despite being a woman of modern thoughts and ideologies, we are chained by these donts just because we are too vulnerable to hurt the religious sentiments of our parents and the regressive society which means everything to them.\\nDespite the government\\'s efforts on criminalizing any kind of discriminatory behavior during menstruation, and demolishing menstrual huts in Achham, Surkhet, Dailekh, Bajhang, Salyan and other districts, the practice is still present loud and proud in every household of the country. The poignant part is that everyone is getting so used to this practice that it is not seen as discrimination. Society is evolving, people are adapting to all sorts of technologies and innovations, they are challenging their way of life yet their mindset is static and changing that has been a slow burn.\"Everyone wants change, but no one wants to change\". The challenge, of addressing the socio-cultural taboos and beliefs in menstruation, is compounded by the lack of knowledge and understanding of puberty, menstruation, and reproductive health. Thus, there is a need to follow a strategic approach to combat these issues.\\nThe solution to all this is simple and can be covered by one word MINDSET. Unless we change our mindset and grow out of the religious stigma, this practice is going nowhere. Rather than taking it as a shame, its about time we celebrated it as the greatest gift of human life. We all were born because there was someone menstruating; its a celebration of life, celebration of womanhood, and celebration of women power. Rather than being whispered in ears and wrapped in newspapers, it shall be a normal day act. Just think about it, men secrete sperms every single day, we do not consider them untouchables. Women do the same thing once a month and there is all the fuss about that. To change the mindset and outlook at this boon (currently misunderstood as sin), there is still a long way to go and the journey starts with you.',\n",
       " \"\\nFor centuries, we Nepalis have dreamed of owning real estate before we retire. We may link real estate with prestige and a safe investment vehicle, which is why we want to possess it. We also wish to use real estate to produce passive income to help with our monthly or recurrent bills and relieve financial stress after retirement. However, a lack of liquidity, lesser cash flow (from rentals), expensive repair costs, and having to deal with tenants (both good and bad) can all be major roadblocks to landlords achieving their objectives. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are financial structures used by countries such as the United States and India to hold real estate and avoid these issues. REITs, on the other hand, do not exist in Nepal, so Nepali investors are missing out on this potential.\\nFirst, let's understand REITs. They are companies that own or finance income-producing real estate across a range of property sectors and are mostly traded on the stock exchange. They typically own commercial properties such as towers, shopping malls, apartment buildings, hospitals, and care facilities, which create higher rental yields and an increase in value. They are required by law to pay the bulk of their taxable profit to their investors in the form of dividends (usually 90%). Dividends are given out on a monthly or quarterly basis. Let's look at some of the biggest concerns with real estate ownership and how REITs can help.\\n\\nHigh-cost barrier to entry: Over the last decade, real estate prices have skyrocketed. Within a decade, a property purchased for Rs 300,000 per aana on the outskirts of Butwal has increased in value to Rs 2 million. It is really difficult for an average Nepali with an average job to acquire land in big cities, where prices start at Rs 1 million per aana. To be able to purchase them, you'll need to save for years. REITs are available for purchase at a fraction of the price of common or preferred shares on the stock exchange where they are traded. This will ensure that everyone will be able to invest in REITs.\\nLower capital gain: Because we don't have REITs in Nepal, we can't make a direct comparison between their performance and that of real estate. Using data from the United States, which has seen a boom in real estate gains, we can show that REITs outperform real estate by a significant margin. As seen in the graph, Vanguard Real Estate ETFs (VNQ) returned 100.92 percent capital gain from 2010 to 2021, whereas the average real estate return was 44 percent throughout the same time period. Only four states have surpassed VNQ's performance throughout this time span.\\nLower cash flow opportunity: One of the most lucrative aspects of owning real estate for retirees is the ability to generate cash flow or rents. As shown in the graph, REIT dividend yield beats total state rent collection by over 45 percent in the United States.\\n\\nEven in Nepal, a Rs 40 million property in Kathmandu (identical to the one I'm renting for my office) brings in Rs 20,000 per month per floor. Two floors are rented out, while the third serves as a living area for the landlords. As a result, it earns Rs 40,000 thousand while saving you Rs 20,000 meaning Rs 60,000 per month, or Rs 720,000 per year. This is only a 1.8 percent gain. VNQ may create Rs 1.46 million per year and Rs 121,666.67 per month with the same amount of money at a 3.65% return - the amount of money needed to live comfortably in Nepal.\\n\\nRisk management: While real estate is a low-risk, high-yielding investment, REITs diversify it and make it even safer. REITs own a variety of income-producing properties in a variety of industries. Even if one property or industry fails, they will still be able to make money from the remaining ones. It will, however, be extremely difficult for the average real estate investor to replicate.\\nLiquidity issue: Selling and buying property is a time-consuming process that takes 30-45 days from listing to closing, which can be troublesome if liquidity is required. REITs, on the other hand, can be sold with a single click and money deposited into your bank account within a week (at max).\\n\\nIn 2020, an investor who invested $135,000 in the United States in 2010 would have made $98,753.76 in dividends (73 percent return) and $135,000 in capital gain (100 percent return). At the same time period, a real estate investor would have made $26,668.39 in rents (19.75 percent return) and $59,710.5 in capital gain (44.23 percent), while being exposed to all the risks mentioned above. REITs investors (173 percent total return) would be 109.02 percent ($147,177) better off than investors in real estate (63.98 percent total return).\\nWhile there are dangers associated with REITs like fees, tax treatment, and investing in unsuitable or maturing REITs, they also provide an opportunity for investors to earn passive income while avoiding risks. In countries like the United States, many mutual funds and retirees have taken advantage of this to achieve early retirement or a safer retirement. REITs reduce or eliminate issues such as liquidity (in comparison to real estate, which takes time to trade), maintenance costs, and dealing with tenants, as well as lowering risk and providing increased cash flow, capital gain, and a lower barrier to entry. For investors, introducing REITs to Nepal would be a fantastic opportunity.\",\n",
       " '\\nIn almost all the polls conducted prior to the 2016 presidential election in the US, Hillary Clinton led Trump in every age group except one: Trump convincingly beat her among those 65 or older. Trump spoke of a time when America was supposedly great and told the country that he wanted to restore Americas greatness once again. His speeches regularly drummed up the anxieties of social change, the nostalgia about an imagined past, and the unfounded claim that there was an existential threat looming over America primarily because Americas culture was unravelling from within and there were external forces trying to take down America from without.\\nPerhaps that doesnt sound too alien to Nepali ears because right now that is what we are witnessing from the elderly Nepali elites, especially those who have big presence in the social mediathose ever ready to blame federalism, secularism, the new Constitution, the new republic, and anything in between for all things bad happening around them. The Nepali elderly elitesthose who were able to reap the most benefits from the unitary, Kathmandu-centric, unsecular, nominally democratic system under the monarchywant us to believe that if not for them, Nepal as a nation-state would no longer be existent on the map.\\nWhat explains this revanchist mood among the elderly elites? Writing for the popular psychology magazine Psychology Today, the psychologist and author Thomas Chamorro claims that, as we get older, our diminishing level of curiosity stunts our openness to experience; the gradual decrease in our information-processing capacity makes us see things in more categorical or black and white terms; and our desire for order and structure balks at proactive adaptation, effort, and improvisation. Further, psychologists have also pointed out that the moral values one grows up with or the worldview one is taught as a child plays a huge role on peoples notion of right and wrong, which often lasts for a lifetime. Perhaps, that partly explains why our elderly elites are dyspeptic about recent changes. In the Brexit referendum of 2016, for example, 72 percent of those aged between 18 to 24 voted remain but still lost to those who voted leave because people over the age of 65 had disproportionate impact on the referendum results.\\nDespite young people having to live with the decision of the referendum for an average of 69 years, it has been decided for them by people who will only have to live with it for an average of 16 years, wrote one graduate student for the magazine Vox. Put simply: The long-term effect of Brexit will not be felt by those who overwhelmingly voted for it. Because they will be dead.\\nBecause the elders have less stake in the future of the country, they are skeptical about changes regardless of whether they are positive or negative, and are more inclined to look backwards, mostly to an imagined past when everything was supposedly hunky-dory. Whereas the youths, owing to their aspirations about the times ahead, are less fearful and more accepting of the social changes.\\nYoung Bob Dylan spoke of this general trend in his song The Times They Are A-Changin when he sang, Come mothers and fathers/ Throughout the land/ And dont criticize/ What you cant understand/ Your sons and your daughters/ Are beyond your command/ Your old road is rapidly agin/ Please get out of the new one/ If you cant lend your hand/ For the times they are a-changin. Dylan wrote this song in the 1960s as an archetypal protest anthem when the Blacks in America were fighting for equal rights under the law.\\nThe counterculture movement that developed in the Western world between mid-1960s to mid-1970s accelerated the Civil Rights Movement, the Feminist Movement, the Free Speech Movement and raised awareness against the traditional and mostly arbitrary modes of authority that directly or indirectly controlled peoples lives in the Western world.\\nTo expect an equivalent movement from Nepali youths, however, would be to ask too much from them, for the youths in our country are mostly happy to remain as the ideological appendages of the elders, failing to carve out their own individual identity while inheriting the blinkered worldview that defines the hoary heads.\\nUnfortunately, our youths are happy playing monkeys in the streets parroting the boilerplate lines that flows from their leaders, obsessing with the latest brands of bikes, and vying for greener pastures in faraway lands at the first opportune moment. I bring this up because I dont think this is so much an indictment of the youths as it is of their parents who have thwarted the critical thinking abilities of their kids.\\nEnlightenment is mans release from his self-incurred tutelage, claimed Immanuel Kant, the eighteenth-century German philosopherunfortunately, our parents (I include myself as well) havent received the memo even after these many centuries. The elder elites know that there will be no one to mount any challenge on their authority, not at least any time soon. Perhaps that too explains the solipsism, the puffed up feeling of ones indispensability that we see in our elderly elites.\\nBefore anybody accuse me of being a tradition-defying nihilist, heres a blog What will the conservatives conserve? that I wrote a week ago which tries to show my appreciation of conservative values. However, the conservatism that we see in Nepal, I believe, is too backward, atavistic, and hence indefensible in so many ways. There is an urgent need to reimagine our national identity such that a vast majority feels included in the democratic process, and federalism and secularism provide us the mid-way forward. Of course, it may not be the only way, but it is the mid-way mark that we have reached to incorporate the voices of dissent that have festered in our societies for many years. We also need to keep in mind that if we are to forestall any demands on multi-national autonomous states(which I think will be disastrous for a country like ours) we need to find a middle ground around political principles like constitutionalism, the rule of law, and democratic accountability. In order to do that the elderly elites need to trust the process and stop sowing doubts in the population about federalism, secularism and the new Constitution. The Constitution must be seen as a living document that is amenable to change through amendments and will invariably do so toward forming a just and equitable Nepal.\\nIn the lead up to the 2016 election in the US, an article titled The Flight 93 Election, authored under a pseudonym, made a huge splash in the conservative circles of the country. In it, the author had quite dramatically analogized the 2016 election to one of the planes, United Airlines Flight 93, that was highjacked by al-Qaeda terrorists on September 11, 2001, and had asked the readers what they would do under the circumstances? Whether they would charge the cockpit even though they didnt know how to fly or land the plane, or they would simply do nothingnot even tryand wait for their deaths which was certain? For the author Hillarys presidency meant that death was certain, whereas Trumps meant that they would still have the chance of survival because it would mean that they had charged the cockpit and taken control of the plane even if they didnt know what was going to happen next. The conservatives charged the cockpit, elected Trump, and floundered with the country for next four years. It seems that our elderly elites feel the same about federalism, secularism, and the new republicthey want us to think that if they dont charge the cockpit Nepal will cease to exist. Well, it will be great if we took some lessons from four years of Trump.',\n",
       " '\\nThere was a time when I regularly visited conservative media news sites. In fact, I still do although the frequency has considerably decreased these days. I consume conservative media not only because I like listening to and reading all viewpoints and challenging my own opinions, but also because I genuinely think that the conservative thinkers have got a lot of things rightespecially about the human nature and the nature of societythat has been proven to be true time and again in history.\\nContrary to common misconception, conservative thinkers are not a monolithic block of people who think alike in all situations. The nuances that go into forming their ideologies is as intricate and thoughtful as any; and is based on a deep realism about history, culture, society, and human psychology. Take the case of Edmund Burke, the patron saint and founder of modern-day conservatism from the eighteenth century, for example. While Burke adamantly stood against any kind of revolution  la the French Revolution from taking place in England, he also stood against the English monarchy when it came to the treatment of the colonized people. He supported the sovereignty of the colonized based on the recognition of their rights and led the impeachment trial against Warren Hastings, the erstwhile Governor-General of Bengal, who was accused of corruption and maltreatment of the Indian people. He was a Whig who regularly voiced his opposition against King George IIIs government and advocated against Englands policies in support of the revolutionaries in America for which the Americans feel indebted to this day.\\nIn Reflections on the Revolution in France published in 1790, a year after the fall of Bastille, Burke urged caution against any radical changes and declared that the society is a partnership of the dead, the living and the unborna quote that is invoked ad nauseam by many conservative thinkers, often without full realization of its meaning. Burke doubted the efficacy of the changes brought by social engineering and argued in favor of change that was gradual and organic. The spiral of violence that lasted for generations in post-revolutionary France in fact vindicated Burke, who slowly but surely, was put on a pedestal by thinkers of conservative persuasion who later followed in his footsteps. Burke wasnt only suspicious of radical changes, but also questioned whether reason and human rationality alone could solve human afflictions. Given Burkes skepticism about the efficacy of social engineering via radical change and his pessimism about human nature, I have often wondered what Burke would think of the changes in Nepal.\\nIn his book The Conservative Mind, the American political thinker Russell Kirk, writes: Burke has no expectation that men can be kept from social change; neither is rigidity of form desirable. Change is inevitable and is designed providentially for the larger conservation of society; properly guided, change is a process of renewal. In other words, Burke supports social change as long as it is properly guided and done in a piecemeal manner because change leads to renewal of our societies and an even greater bonding in our communities. A state without the means of some change, Burke contends, is without the means of its conservation. Further, with respect to equality, Burke writes:\\nWhatever each man can separately do, without trespassing upon others, he has a right to do for himself; and he has a right to a fair portion of all which society, with all its combinations of skill and force, can do in his favor. In this partnership all men have equal rights; but not to equal things.\\nBurke was indeed not an egalitarian and did believe in social hierarchies; however, he did also strongly believe that equal justice is a natural right while equal dividend is not. He anticipated the follies and violence of communismwhich tries to level societies in the name of distributing equal dividendway ahead than most and was again proved correct by what transpired in the USSR and China in the early- and mid-twentieth century. Burke also supported the civil rights of Catholics, a religious minority, in England which cost him his parliamentary seat and stood staunchly against the practice of slavery. In replying to an anti-Catholic demagogue in the British parliament, Burke once proclaimed, The only religion I profess is that of universal humanity and benevolence.\\nNow, if we compare the general idea of Burkes notion of equality and social change against the backdrop of the Nepali context, it compels us to take stock of several facts still prevalent in our society. First thing that comes to mind is the notion of human dignity: whereas conservatism, in its modern iteration, has, if only reluctantly, come to accept the individual as a sovereign and human dignity as inherent in all men and women; Nepali conservatism, on the other hand, has hardly budged from its centuries-old mindset. A large section of the population is still treated as less than human simply because they were born in the wrong caste, or the wrong geographical region, or in the wrong religion. In so far as the conservatives alienate and find excuses to exclude these groups of people from a shared transcendental national identity, conservatism, as a social and political power, Burke would argue, is bound to atrophy by the day.\\nSecond fact that would most likely rile Burke would be the way religion is practiced in our country. Whether we admit it or not, a lot of the social ills stem from the way our religion is conceived. Religion, no doubt, provides an anchor to our lives and guides us through both psychological and materialistic deficiencies; it inspires us to appreciate the beauty and the sublime. Hence, there is no point in fighting back religion for it will remain so long as the mankind survives, and it is a glue that holds our culture together. However, there is an urgent need to reimagine our religion so that it incorporates and responds to modern sensibilities. Mere lip-service will not suffice, people need to seriously change the way they think to regain the trust of the minoritiesfor starters, questioning your own privileges that have no ties to science and reason would be an essential first step. Accepting secularism as one of our national creeds would be another: a nation where more than eighty percent of the population follow Hinduism doesnt need to cry wolf when secularism might in fact enlarge the tent and attract more followers.\\nThird, Burke would say that we need to reimagine our nationality identity such that Nepalis from every geographical region feel included and heard in the decision-making mechanism of the country. If monarchy and religion were something that propped up our national identity in the past, we now need to foster a new identity, perhaps something along the lines of what Francis Fukuyama calls the creedal identity, based on political principles such as constitutionalism, the rule of law, and democratic accountability. Any more strain on the national identity can prove fatal for our country, so the more inclusive we become, the stronger our national identity becomes. As a country we need to work toward bringing the disillusioned into the fold and that should be done by enlarging our hearts and minds, not by turning inward and cocooning ourselves.\\nAmong other things Burke would also probably take issue with runaway consumerism, the destruction of the environment, and a civil society which is destructively divided along party lines. Our civil society is in urgent need of a renewal where interpersonal relations are not just built on a political basis but also in various other ways such as community service, sports, reading clubs etc. We need to find ways other than party politics to establish bonds among fellow citizens and create trust among each other.\\nConservatives can play a constructive role in the remaking of a modern Nepal that is open, free, democratic, tolerant, and just. Conservatives can no longer support an edifice of governance that perpetuates structural discrimination, and still believe to be relevant in modern day politics. Thankfully, the chasms we see in our country are not irreconcilable, not at least anywhere near what we see in the US or even in India, where communal violence is often stoked for political gains. Conservatism is a necessary force; its just that the conservatives need to find the right ideas to conserve.',\n",
       " '\\nA couple of days ago a friend of mine tagged me on a Facebook post shared by the radio-journalist-turned-politician Rabindra Mishra. The guy has finally come out of the closet, he wrote, adding his bit on the link before sharing it on his own Facebook wall. Bibeksheel Sajha Party President Mishraa neophyte in the Nepali political scene who has continuously touted the merits of alternative politicshad apparently put out a manifesto where he argued for the abolition of federalism and called for a plebiscite to decide the future of secularism in Nepal. It was ironical that a politician who has essentially built up his political career riding the backs of progressive youths in the country had recycled and repackaged his deeply held personal prejudices and was serving as an alternative the same old ideas of militant majoritarianism that brought us here in the first place. It was ironical but not very surprising.\\nMishra until now had parried away questions relating to his political ideology by appealing to a sort of transcendental ideology where ideologies, in the old sense, would be non-existent and instead there would be an ad hoc application of all kinds of political principles. He has finally ended up dashing the hopes of thousands of forward-looking youths who strive for a just and equitable tomorrow. By parasitically tapping into the deep wells of energy, positivity, optimism, and vigor of the youths from his party, Mishra has not only betrayed their agendas but also revealed his opportunistic and reactionary sideperhaps the only sidethat is bent on misleading the movement of the youths in the country. His proposal wasnt surprising also because a lot of us had already guessed that by hewing to no ideology at all, Mishra was in fact aiming to curry favor from the ancien regime which has been eagerly waiting for its own resurrectionist. No sooner had he revealed his manifesto, the chattering class of Kathmandu, a place that is as callous as it is disdainful and apathetic to the rest of the country, expressed a collective sigh of relief for here was a man who has finally spoken their mind.\\nIn a gleeful taunt aimed at people who were dismayed by Mishras newfound regressive ideology and, perhaps, at Mishra himself, the TV talk show host Vijay Kumar Panday, tweeted that Mishra wasnt saying anything new at all; rather it was the people whose legs were made of strawtranslation: those who support secularism and federalism were overly reacting to a commonly expressed view. Another TV show host Bhushan Dahal, known for his mawkish nostalgia toward the ousted monarchy, put out an encouraging tweet backing Mishra and urging him, in his own roundabout style, to stick to his agenda at all costs and prove his mettle.\\nWhat these tweeting heads do not consider is that just because there is a majority which potentially supports their agendas of dissolution of federalism and establishment of a Hindu kingdom doesnt mean that the nation needs to blindly follow their unrestrained passions. They forget that Nepal, as a country, is a representative democracy with an established Constitution, which is in fact inherently suspicious of and hostile toward any form of majoritarianism. And, yes, the Constitution is there precisely because it needs to protect the legs of straw of the minorities who have historically been bereft of their voices. That is what federalism and secularism do: they allow for people from all faiths (or no faith at all), class, caste, and geographical regions to feel included in the decision-making process of this democratic country. To be sure, Nepali federalism is not without its faults, not least because of leaders who operate with the feudal mindset. However, those questioning the legitimacy and efficacy of federalism and secularism need to understand that federalism in Nepal was not instituted to address the needs of the Kathmandu dwellers who were already well off. There is not going to be any drastic change in the lives of people like Rabindra Mishra. Rather, it was instituted to be responsive to and redress the grievances of the historically marginalized who have finally, if only in fits and starts, found their voices.\\nBeside his deep-seated suspicion toward federalism and secularism, Mishras proposal is also representative of something more insidious that passes as intellectuality in the Nepali intellectual sphere: it showcases extreme egocentrism and ethnocentrism probably rooted in the Brahminical knows-it-all psyche which is reluctant to question its own privileges and tone down its elitism. Whether they see the connection or not, Mishra and his ilk are essentially arguing in support of a system that has, for centuries, denied the minorities of their individual dignity and humanity. Both federalism and secularism seek to redress the deficiencies in our society, and they depend on the honesty and integrity of the leaders who pledge to abide by its principles. If there is anything that needs to change, it is the mindset of our leadersnot the Constitution. The Constitution is working just fine as recently demonstrated by the landmark decision from the Supreme Court. Of course, it needs to be more and more inclusive, but there is no need to jump off the cliff with Mishra.',\n",
       " \"\\nImagine a job interview where the interviewer asks the candidate to mention five good traits about themselves. But instead of a candidate with a masters' degree and an excellent resume you have a student from maybe the fifth grade or the second grade on the chair. What answer do you expect?\\nWell, I tried finding that by conducting a small survey among students from the second to the seventh grades in March 2021. I asked them to write five good and five bad things about themselves on a piece of paper. There were six classes, and each class had around 22 students on average. I collected their papers and noted the most repeated traits. In this piece of writing, I have tried to present an overview on the students beliefs and how they tend to concur with some pre-existing theories of moral development.\\nStudents in grade six and seven mentioned that they are good at friendships. They respect the elders and they always do their homework on time. They follow traffic rules and cross the road through zebra crossings. As bad traits, they mentioned that they get irritated and angry easily. They use their mobile phones or watch television a lot and dont sleep on time. Some of them even said that they cheat during exams.\\nIn grade four and five, students mentioned they do their homework every day and they are polite. They help their mother in household chores, respect elders and they have really good handwriting. They also cleaned their room themselves. Sharing their bad traits they wrote that they have little control over anger and patience. They sometimes get angry at friends and family and say things that they dont mean. They are also aware of the fact that they hurt others feelings knowingly or unknowingly. Some peculiar responses however, were the ones mentioning that they don't like religions other than their own, some being addicted to TikTok and some saying that they don't like pink color.\\nThe notes from grades three and two were quite interesting. It is the phase when children start developing their preliminary sense of good and bad. For good traits, they also mentioned helping their mother in house chores, throwing the waste in the dustbin and waking up early. They thought it was good that they shared food and other things like pencils and erasers with their friends. Not doing homework on time, watching a lot of television or having bad handwriting was a bad trait for them. They also kept losing their items (pencils, erasers, etc) and they didnt speak in English during the classes. Some said that they make noise in the class and get angry very easily. The responses from this group which really got my attention were I am fatting (getting fat) and I am not good at social (socializing).\\nWhile looking at the wide variety of responses from the children about the good and bad traits, we should not forget that they arent the ones who dictated those traits for themselves. The notion of good and bad traits is not inherited but it rather comes from an individuals sense of morality. According to Swiss psychologist Jean Piagets theory of moral development, children are in the heteronomous phase which can be identified by the idea that rules come from authority figures in ones life, such as parents, teachers, and those rules are permanent no matter what. Children , in large part, are also influenced by the prize and punishment norm where good behavior is rewarded and bad behavior is punished. The severity of punishment is also directly proportional to the bad behavior. Thus, children regard consequences more important than the action that will cause it. For example: a student with the fear of failing exams might end up cheating in exams to pass despite knowing that cheating is a bad thing to do.\\nThis phase is seen in children from the age of five. As they grow into adults they enter the autonomous phase where the action itself is seen as more important than its consequences. They begin to understand that different people have different morals and that morality is not necessarily universal.\\nAmerican psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg expanded this theory on a stage model similar to Piagets, and proposed three levels with six stages of moral development. Individuals create their realm of morality from the universal experiences of punishment and rewards, approval and disapproval from the society, community respect and disrespect as well as self-condemnation. He named the three levels: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional, each accommodating two stages. For the survey I conducted, Kohlbergs first and second levels of moral development would be in focus.\\nThe first or pre-conventional level has two stages: Stage 1ethics of obedience and punishment in which an individuals sense of morality is motivated by the desire to avoid punishment and Stage 2ethics of self-interest where an individuals morality is based on whether an activity serves them back or not. These stages can be seen in motion with the responses from students where they believed that doing homework on time and sharing food as well as other items with their friends was a good thing to do.\\nThe second or conventional level also has two stages: Stage 3ethics of social norms and Stage 4ethics of law and order. In stage 3 individuals shape their actions and mindset according to the approval or disapproval they are getting from the social construct around them. The responses from children where they believe that respecting elders and helping their mother in household chores is a good trait perhaps comes from the approval that arrives after those actions. More or less it is the desire to be tagged as a good child. Stage 4 shapes the idea of morality in an individuality based on their culpability and presence of a central law. They have to be more responsible regarding their action or inaction. One person violating a law might initiate a chain reaction which results in everyone doing the same thus a duty to uphold laws and rules comes as an obligation. Stage 4 can be seen being reflected on the students notion of following traffic rules (present in older students from 6-7th grades) and speaking English in school (present in younger students below the 6th grade) as good traits.\\nI took this survey to understand each class better; their problems and their strengths and how I can help them as a teacher and mentor. After getting these answers from them, I feel like I have got a chance to know them better. It was surprising to discover that the notion of good and bad traits that my friends and I had a decade ago while we were in school is more or less similar to that these present-day children have. We had very little control over anger or patience. We too wanted to be socially accepted as good boy or good girl. I believe all of us undergo a lot of learning as a child but as we grow up into adults both learning and unlearning is equally necessary.\\nOn a side note, many students mentioned watching television a lot in the survey. Back when I was in school a decade ago, smart phones were not so mainstream in my town. But we watched television a lot. As the internet and smartphones proliferated I had grown this notion that maybe young people dont watch television as much (or not at all). However, I was wrong, television is here to stay. Every generation loves to assume and comment regarding the upcoming generations without realizing some of those assumptions and comments might be far from truth. It would have never occurred to me that fatting or body appearance would find space in a second grade students morality. This whole ordeal has ultimately taught me the importance of honest conversations with children which might be difficult as parents and schools grow busier.\\n(The author is a maths teacher for grade 12 and a computer teacher for the lower secondary level)\",\n",
       " '\\nWastewater is a complex mixture containing contaminated water from sewers, storm runoff from streets, lawns, farms, and other land areas, generated at both household and industrial scale. As such, there is a possibility of the presence of debris from streets, vehicle spillovers, pesticides, fertilizers, and human as well as animal waste. The mixture thus becomes a potential carrier of various types of microbes, harmful chemicals, heavy metals, and other hazards. The practice of disposal of treated wastewater into the river or other water bodies is quite common in developing countries. Such practices include direct disposal of partially treated or untreated wastewater in the rivers and subsequently to groundwater sources. The wastewater discharged into the river systems in developing countries exceed the threshold limit of 2-5 cubic meter per day set by the Environmental Protection Agency, a US-based regulatory body that sets a guideline for environmental assessment, research and education. Given the increased demand for water and shortage of its supply, people from developing countries rely on underground water sources. The utilization of these contaminated groundwaters by humans may pose a significant health risk to human, resulting in the occasional outbreaks of water-borne diseases.\\nHistory and significances of wastewater surveillance\\nWastewater treatment plant is the ultimate destination of all the harmful substances produced on the surface of the earth. Surveillance of the wastewater is fundamental in determining the harmful content that might get transported through the surface water or remains stacked in the underground aquifers. Regular monitoring of wastewater may provide an alternative medium for early warning of a potential outbreak in future, as such, the field of wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) is of growing interest among scientists globally.\\nWBE usually includes analysis of water to monitor public health indicators and to measure the load of pathogens in a community including SARS-CoV-2. The history of WBE dates back to the mid-1800s (1849-1854) during the cholera epidemic in Great Britain. In the early days of the epidemic, cholera was assumed to be an air-borne disease and not waterborne. John Snow, a British physician currently known as the father of modern epidemiology, studied death rates in two different districts that supplied water from a particular section of Thames river in London and proposed that cholera was a water-borne disease.\\nThe term WBE was used for monitoring drug consumption for the first time in 2001. Later, in 2005, this approach was applied by a group of researchers in Italy to estimate the usage of cocaine. However, before the aforementioned two instances, the application of wastewater surveillance system in disease surveillance had already been adopted by the researchers in Israel to monitor polio outbreaks in 1988. The data generated by this environmental surveillance can be utilized by epidemiologist to describe the burden of disease in the population and its trend by applying modelling approaches, which allows decision-makers to respond rapidly toward the management of outbreaks. There has been sufficient evidence of the performance of wastewater surveillance for enteric viruses (major causes of gastroenteritis and reproduction in a human host). The approach has successfully monitored the spatial and temporal extent of enteric virus circulation in different countries\\nFuture possibilities on wastewater surveillance\\nThe SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be discharged through human feces. Researchers all over the world have been developing a standard protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material from wastewater using WBE, for designing early warning systems to alert the presence of the pathogen in a given community. The WBE technique is cost-effective and comparatively less time-consuming. Although least developed countries do not have a centralized system for sewage collection and treatment, investigating samples collected from the open sewer pipe, drainage, decentralized sewage system from the community can be helpful in identifying infection hotspots and tracking the waves of disease transmission.\\nIn the case of SARS-CoV-2, there is chance of discharge of viruses from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The asymptomatic carriers can be a possible source of shedding the viruses into the environment, thereby enhancing the potential transmission of diseases within the community. Therefore, identifying the asymptomatic carriers is necessary to track the source of infection and break the chain of disease transmission. Identifying asymptomatic carriers is, however, a challenging task that requires well-trained personnel, and is expensive as well as tedious. Therefore, monitoring of wastewater is an important alternative prospect for early warning systems to determine the presence of diseases in a given community, and can help prevent spread of diseases. In addition, the wastewater monitoring approach can be integrated with several other technologies to discover undetermined issues related to the population. This environmental approach could be of high value to scientists and policymakers globally for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for lower middle income countries with poor resources and financial capacity.\\n(A PhD in Environmental Engineering, the author is a research fellow at Policy ResearchInstitute and can be reached at sar1234tan@gmail.com )\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nThe global population of Asiatic elephant has been estimated at around 48,32351,680 in the wild (Menon and Tiwari 2019). The number of elephants in the world has been quickly declining over the past several decades. Wild Asian elephants (Elephans maximus) is classified as endangered species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list and Appendix I species in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).\\nThe Bardia National Park (BNP) is one of the largest and diverse protected areas (IUCN Category II) in tarai covering an area of 968 square kilometers. This national park has a long success story in conservation. Bardia is home to nearly 80 elephants, about one-third of the total population in the country. Proper management of grassland, a large number of water bodies, and floodplains make this national park a suitable habitat for elephants. The role of elephants in the forest ecosystem is very vital and they are symbolized as ecosystem engineers' and commonly referred to as a 'keystone' species. Similarly, elephants are an integral part of our culture and heritage. In the Hindu religion, the elephant is a sacred animal and is worshipped as the living incarnation of Lord Ganesh.\\nDrivers of human-elephant conflict\\nThe Asiatic elephant is an herbivore which can eat about 150 kilograms of plant materials in its active eating duration of 16 hours a day. These giant animals prefer to live in a large evergreen forest for their survival and their long-ranging habits inevitably bring them in direct contact with humans leading to conflict. Dr Dinesh Neupanes research article on Status, patterns, and potential mitigation of human-elephant conflict in Nepal and elephant habitat use in Bardia National Park, Nepal showed that only 20% of the total area in BNP was highly favorable for elephants which may not be sufficient to hold the existing numbers.\\nElephants are reported as the leading cause of crop raiding and degradation, and communities also often suffer property damage, human injuries, and deaths. Traditional farming practices such as growing rice and maize, planting banana trees in yards, and fermenting alcohol inside the home attract this megafauna in the human landscape. The low-level subsistence farmers living near protected areas depend on the forest resources increasing risks of conflict. Poverty also reduces a households coping ability and adaptive capacity to respond to elephant damages. Population growth, habitat fragmentation, regular highway activities are few other drivers of human-elephant conflict in Bardia.\\nInvasive plant species such as Chromolaena odorata and Lantana camara inside protected areas modify plant community structure which reduces plant species richness and diversity affecting food resources for elephants.\\nStatus in Bardia\\nOne Nareswor Sapkota, 78, from Basgadhi municipality 8 Baishapur was trampled to death on June 16. Altogether 41 human fatalities and 115 human injuries were reported in Bardia since 2000. Three persons have lost their lives since mid-April which shows the severity of the problem. Retaliatory killing of elephants is not seen but a few were injured during conflict. This issue is gaining more and more attention in conservation. The nature of each conflict is completely different from another, which is one of the great challenges in managing the conflict. Recently a herd of wild elephants entered Bardia through Khata Corridor from Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in India which is becoming a matter of concern.\\nMitigation practices \\nThe concrete cement walls and electric wires installed in the fringe of the forest are the most effective applied mitigation measures to mitigate human-elephant conflict in Bardia, according to the research article titled Human-Elephant Conflict and Mitigation Measures in Buffer Zone of Bardia National Park, Nepal by Rabin Paudel and team. Application of repellant methods such as firecrackers, drums, and acoustic deterrents are practiced in some areas to ward the tuskers away. Cottage like structure (machan) is constructed to look out for elephants entering agriculture lands.\\nUS-funded Hariyo Ban Program is providing support to local people in large-scale commercial citrus lemon farming. There is a provision of financial compensation to those who are affected by human-elephant conflict. However, people are not satisfied with these packages due to insufficient compensation, logistical challenges, lack of transparency, reduced local understanding of program scope and limitations, and fraudulent claims.\\nThe World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), and a few cooperatives are becoming successful in helping women, youths, and forest-dependent marginalized families to start their own small-scale agriculture and eco-tourism based business thereby reducing pressure on forest and biodiversity. Capacity building and awareness programs are necessary to change the perception of people toward elephants.\\nIdentification of problematic elephants is necessary and their regular monitoring using radio collar is crucial. The BNP in support of the IUCN, the Global Nature Fund, and Ujyalo Nepal has started a program Hatti Khabar in Tiger FM to disseminate information to the public regarding elephant activities.\\nLong-term habitat enriching methods such as fodder plantations, soil management, and creating water resources like water holes inside the forest are also being implemented. Management of forest fire, grassland, and invasive plant species is necessary to restrict these megafaunas inside the forest. Forest corridors have also proved to be a critical connection for migratory elephants.\\nWay forward\\nMore research is needed to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of human-elephant conflict in Bardia. Conflict mitigation cannot be solved by the BNP alone. It requires multidisciplinary collaboration between different levels of government, INGOs, NGOs, indigenous tharu community, women groups, biologists, media, and locals in formulating conflict mitigating plans which also helps to strengthen the human-elephant co-existence. No single solution is effective and different management approaches need to be integrated to address the problem proactively.\\n(The author is currently pursuing Master's in Biodiversity and Environmental Management at the Tribhuvan University, Kirtipur)\",\n",

But the bigger question remains, will government walk the talk, or is it just another gimmick for vote-bank politics?\\nTalking about some of the glitches of this allocation, allow me to put before you some of the thought-provoking questions. Of 7.45%, what percentage has been allocated for the upliftment of long-term fundamentals of health care delivery system? Only miniscule!

Rs 4 billion has been allocated for high dependency units (HDU), intensive care units (ICU), ventilators etc. What about human resources? Or, have they been talking about artificial-intelligence driven HDU and ICU? Come on! Have some foresight. The hospital I work in has one ventilator with cobwebs all around. Also, a concept of satellite clinic has been brought up. Well, this is nothing but a smart move to cover up government doctors inadequacy statistics by shunting human resources of higher institutions to the periphery. This is certainly not going to help in the long run.\\nGovernments come and go. So much so that we've seen over 20 governments in the past 30 years. What remains is bureaucracy, the backbone of all government bodies. While the leaders have received their fair share of criticism, pinning blame solely on them doesnt suffice to explain the situation weve been witnessing today. Bureaucrats are as responsible for this nightmare as the politicians, if not more. The government can only implement policies if the bureaucrats deliver to the best of their ability. But everything in the end boils down to inefficiency and corruption because there seems to be no ethical limit to their pursuit of money. Today most of the hospitals are spending a fortune in those sector which guarantees them handsome amount of commission. From construction to procurement of equipment, corruption is rampant everywhere. I can say this from my personal experience working as a medical officer at the Sunsari District Hospital in Inaruwa. The pharmacy doesn't have basic medicines. But the hospital premise gets new building year after year for no reason. After completion, they are left unused for years because it was never necessary and what is necessary is nowhere near. What does this tell us? Bureaucracy is no less than a syndicate which has reduced all government hospitals to mere non-functioning garbage. Many potential private hospitals are awaiting validations from the government for the expansion of its service. But the complexity of whole process is so grave that one has to offer a huge amount of money to grease the officials' palm to get go-ahead. Why only money can expedite the whole process and not the will power of bureaucrats? Think about it!\\nThe combined complacency of politicians and bureaucrats has not only undermined the quality of health service but also put the health professionals at the risk of being targeted by patients kins like the incident of Bheri Hospital, Binod Mishra's case and many more. Proper maintenance of patient-doctors/nurses ratio, medical equipment like dialysis machine etc, are not the responsibilities of health professionals to watch over. The healthcare system is now under immense stress. So are health workers. Let us provide health services with adequate sense of security deep inside. Well, that's not too much to ask for.\\nAmidst all doom and gloom, the authorities concerned have yet another chance to prove themselves in this moment of crisis. All it takes is commitment and a radical revolutionary approach because we cant solve the problem by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them, as Einstein said. Or else, bureaucracy will always remain a giant mechanism run by pygmies.\\n(The author is a doctor working at the Sunsari District Hospital in Inaruwa)\",\n",
       " '\\nAs I write this, my heart is heavy with grief and smoldering with anger. Just today there was news of nurses getting mobbed and attacked by the relatives of a patient. It is deeply saddening to see incidents like these come up almost every week and makes one really wonder how many of such incidents actually occur weekly. These incidents make big noise and are all over the media for some days only to abate rather quickly without making actual changes to the laws or policies. Different groups of people react differently, some strongly condemn it with hashtags of jailwithoutbail, the others remark that we should at least not have to hear such news amidst the pandemic and then there are people who find a way to blame the healthcare workers by bringing it down to negligence or lack of communication. There are definitely many factors that fuel the epidemic of violence against healthcare workers, ranging from sheer hooliganism to lack of proper communication. These incidents could easily contribute to burnout which ultimately affects the quality of care that patients receive.\\nHealthcare workers burnout is a complex problem that is often not discussed in our society. It is a work related syndrome characterized by extreme emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a loss of sense of personal accomplishments. In simple words what it means is that they are in a state where they feel they are not in control of their lives, see patients as objects and deem themselves unable to help patients successfully. The factors leading to this state are many. The medical field is a highly demanding one where aspirants learn to prioritize their work before anything else early on. The robust training, followed by long work hours, paperwork and to top all that the struggle to maintain a balanced personal and professional life definitely serves as an alloy leading to burnout. Just the other day I saw a tweet by a doctor who shared a rather woebegone incident of the day his father-in-law committed suicide. He was in the clinic when he received a call from his wife informing him of the sad news and he responded by telling her how he was very busy at the moment and would get back to her later. Needless to say, this triggered a much needed discussion on the sheer impact work and responsibilities have on a physicians life.\\nA study conducted by a team of Nepali doctors and students, which was published in BMC Psychiatry in 2020 stated that 48.8% out of 651 residents and medical students involved in the study were deduced to be burnt out. The increasing cases of abuse against healthcare workers leave them fearing for their safety; further fueling the likelihood of burnout. While this is definitely bad news for anyone working in the medical field or aspiring to do so, it also comes with implications to the public. In recent years there have been a number of studies that correlate physician burnout and its negative impact on the quality of patient care. Doctors are considered to be god and even expected to behave accordingly. There is no room for any mistake for them. This is why discussing this issue in the medical field is absolutely necessary. People need to see doctors for who they are, a human being trained to provide medical services. They too come with their own flaws.\\nViolence at the healthcare setting is not a problem of Nepal alone. The WHO states that 8-38 % of healthcare workers are subjected to work related physical violence at some point in their career. Many more are abused through verbal aggressions. But in Nepal, a lot of these incidents, especially verbal abuse are not seen as a problem and are never reported. We all know the resolution to this epidemic. We need stricter laws, better security and an overall fall in corruption to ensure implementation of laws. But the grim picture is that these solutions will never really be implemented efficiently or at least not unless doctors and nurses start losing their lives because of it. If not, for the well being of healthcare workers then at least for the sake of quality of health services for the public, I hope positive change in some form will be introduced. Until then it is probably in everyones best interest that medical students are taught some form of self defense and hospitals are made with hidden corners where we can go to hide when our lives are being threatened.\\n(The author is currently studying in the third year of MBBS at Maharajgunj Medical Campus)',\n",
       " \"\\nCOVID-19 has overwhelmed the health system across the globe. Sixty-five Nepali resident doctors in Delhi have been tirelessly treating COVID patients for over a year. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), the premier medical institute of India, has been reluctant to recognize even our basic human rights. We have dependent families back home in Nepal but are sharing the workload of patient care amidst the raging COVID-19 crisis in India without an honorarium. We are among the frontline warriors in the fight against COVID, whether at the AIIMS COVID Emergency Area, COVID screening area or at the Intensive Care Unit. The immense delay and apathy toward providing financial security to those of us who are working away from our home country, has increased psychological stress over and above the financial crisis. Nearly all of us have been infected with the deadly disease, with a few needing oxygen support, and have had a hard time to recover. We are in India during a crisis, helping India recover, but are not being taken care of, neither by the Indian Health Ministry nor our own institute.\\nWe have come to India for a post-graduate or doctoral level three-year residency training in MD/MCH/MDS/DM in many different specialities and super-specialities at AIIMS. But, because of the raging pandemic, we are bound to care for COVID patients only. This has significantly cut down our training duration. If we were to do the same training in the US or UK or any other premier institute anywhere in the globe, we would have been paid a basic living expense. There are three Institutes of National Importance (INIs) in India where foreign nationals come to complete residency after clearing the INI CET exam (Institute of National Importance Combined Entrance Test). Other two institutes--the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in Chandigarh and the Jawaharlal Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER) in Puducherry--pay foreign nationals for the work they do but AIIMS does not.\\nWe are not sponsored by the Government of Nepal which has only issued a no objection certificate to be admitted for training as foreign nationals in India. We write the same entrance exams, pass a common national test same as our Indian counterparts to get enrolled in the same course, purely and entirely based on merit, among hugely competitive seats dedicated to any foreign national across the world. We perform the same type of duty for the same duration as our Indian counterparts. Amid the raging second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, we are in extreme financial and psychological crisis with decreasing physical health but are still tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients round the clock, but are unfortunately being ignored for more than a year.\\nThe Delhi High Court in 2013, had directed AIIMS to start paying its foreign doctors on par with Indian doctors. The court had pointed that when it came to a fundamental right available to even non-citizens, to be paid for the work they do, the terms of the prospectus of AIIMS on non-payment to foreign nationals could not be binding. That judgement was later stayed till an appeal filed by AIIMS is adjudicated. The prime minister's office and the Ministry of External Affairs in 2018 then directed the institute to make necessary amendments and release the due salary of the foreign doctors. However, the AIIMS administration is adamant that they will not pay the foreign nationals working as resident doctors. It is noteworthy that even undergraduate and interns are allowed honorarium for COVID duties whereas AIIMS administration is surprisingly unable to draw a distinction between the duties and responsibilities of a professionally trained doctor undergoing post-graduate training from that of interns. The Health Ministry also asked for the financial implications to which AIIMS administration had responded that it would hardly be IRs 60-70 million per annum (a small fraction of AIIMS annual operating budget). We desire for nothing extravagant but are merely asking that we be paid at least daily living expenses for the work we do, which is a basic human right.\\nThe situation has worsened with the pandemic, and we have been reduced to a point of borrowing money in India during a raging crisis when banks are not operating at full capacity due to prohibitory orders in Nepal. Even Indian PM Narendra Modis announcement of insurance policy worth IRs 5 million for the frontline health workers who are treating coronavirus patients does not cover us, as we are foreigners.\\nCOVID-19 has led to unprecedented challenges including difficult duty rosters, travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, isolation stressors and concerns about the spread of the deadly virus back home in Nepal. We have been denied even basic payment against the instructions of Indian PM Modi and the Indian Health Ministry. We, therefore, urge the Nepal government and the Nepali Embassy in India to coordinate with the Indian government to help us get paid.\\n(Collective plea of Nepali Residents at AIIMS in India)\",\n",
       " '\\nTomorrow I am leaving for the far west for a field work on menstruation and today I get my period. What a weird coincidence?\\nI am immediately reminded of my privilege of not having to go to an abandoned hut straight away.\\nThe self-talk was running on my mind just before I went on to my second field work of 2020, the COVID year. My previous field work was in Sarlahi and Janakpur as part of food relief distribution.\\nIts been a few years that I have been working for social concerns and I love visiting different communities and meeting the people there but even now field visits give me excitement and anxiety at the same time. Field visits have been an eye opener for me. On many occasions I have been confronted with my own unconscious biases, putting me through many uncomfortable emotions that ultimately help me grow as a person. I always bury some biases and pre-assumptions that I carried about social issues, there on the field.\\nThis field was really important to me as I was going to Accham. I believe I may not be the only person whose brain is wired to think about Chhaupadi and Rara Lake when we hear Far West.\\nWe were informed that we were not staying in a hotel due to COVID-19 situation and we were about to stay at someones house there. The first thing that hit me was how were we going to manage our period and where were we going to dispose of our pads? And if we told the house owner that we were on our periods, were they going to put us in a Chhau Goth. What would that be like? All those stories and news of how the girls and women there stayed in a small Chhau hut during their menstruation and all those difficulties they faced and the incidents of abuse, violence and death that occurred inside Chhau hut started to play inside our heads.\\nAre we really confident in pursuing this project after all?\\nThe we here is me and my friend Shreya. My trip partner.\\n\\nLuckily, we got to stay in a hotel at Sanfebagar, Accham. The COVID threat was slowly dropping down and few hotels were taking guests. We got a nice room for us and no there were no \"Chhau Goth\" around Sanfebagar. It was a long day and we were exhausted. We had our morning tea at Kathmandu, lunch at Dhangadi and dinner at Accham, the same day. The road trip from Dhangadi to Accham was comfortable and a treat to the soul that continuously strives to be closer to nature. Throughout the trip I was in a state of serenity pointing toward everything I found fascinating as if I were a baby. The scenic view of the haystacks all over the lands in Doti, the deep blue rivers, the green farms and everything present at that moment served me as a happy pill. After a period of lockdown inside the house due to COVID, just being there in the presence of nature and good people felt more than special.\\nThe next morning, we went to Sakot, with some local activists. We were going there to conduct a program about Dignified menstruation and the effect on mental health due to factors related to menstruation. I was allocated to the resource section of mental health. The road was risky and we were an hour late at reaching the school. A group of young girls and women were waiting for us there already and they greeted us with a big but shy smile on their faces.\\nThe program started and all I was expecting from them was to share about the menstrual taboos they followed and believed, and how they are helplessly giving in to all those menstrual stigmas because we went there all over from Kathmandu to break those taboos and stigmas, didnt we? But, to my surprise most of the participants shared their stories of how they lied about their periods at home and stayed inside the house instead of Chhau hut to test whether the taboos are real. To test whether or not god punishes them for breaking the taboos.\\nBoooom, this was the first attack on my pre-assumptions about the Far West.\\nI was totally excited to listen to these stories of brave women, young and old, who spoke with their beautiful Acchami accent about how they were fighting the norms of their society and the anger and determination to root out the stigma that was prevalent in their community was radiating through their eyes and their voices. The credit was all to the local activists who worked to break that Chhau hut in their minds unlike the policy makers who are trying to decrease this problem by decreasing the number of physical Chhau goth. These activists have worked to empower these women to advocate what they learned and to fight to gain a position that they deserved at home and in society regardless of whether or not they are on their periods.\\n\\nThe thing that generated passion to work on this issue for me was not the fact that the society forces people to follow Chhaupadi in the name of culture but to know more about what makes all of us accept such degrading culture. When do we actually start believing that menstruation actually makes anyone impure? At what age? At which moment we decide to never experiment and explore the truth and accept all the ill treatment we receive based on the biological process?\\nWe heard their stories about how they had to do all the outdoor chores while they were menstruating but were given dry bread for meals and restricted to eat most of the foods and are not allowed to drink milk.\\nRupa Saud, 26, shared, My in-laws think I am being over-smart by not staying in the Chhau hut. Back at my home in Surkhet I never had to follow Chhaupadi and nothing ever happened before. Whats the point of keeping our gods alive if we ourselves are going to die in a Chhau hut?\\nSeema Kumari, 20 shared, \"The women here think we are gaining some personal benefits for advocating about this issue. Some of the women here don\\'t wear any kind of pads. We offered to teach them pad-making skills using clothes available at home but they refused and said they will not use any such thing as they have never used anything to manage their periods before and just because you young people went to school doesnt mean you know everything.\\nNow, this was the second attack on my pre-assumption. My preconceived notions were challenged one after another and defeated bravely by the girls. I used to think people there were not being able to manage their periods properly and hygienically because they didn\\'t have access to the materials. I used to think that if we would give them access to materials and skills, half the problem about menstrual hygiene would be solved. But, turns out it\\'s just what I think.\\n\\nAs Socrates puts it, I cannot teach anybody anything, I can only make them think. After listening to these women and girls I felt that they have really started thinking and this thought has led them to take action to test those cultural norms. The reason I ended up there was also because I thought about these issues, I had few unanswered questions I was seeking answers for.\\nLack of resources, information and skills are not the only problems. The mindset established against menstruation is a real problem. Who seeded such a strong fallacy of untouchability toward women on those days of the month? And how did such taboo spread so contagiously among all races, all geographies, and all levels of the people? It is one of many stirring unanswered questions that has been holding the women communities back in many parts of the world. But the positive part is, these questions have started to arise among some people and as long as there are people working to ignite such thoughts more and more, every single person can win and help others win the fight against such taboos on their own.\\nNow, my mind is no more wired to think about Chhaupadi when I hear Far West. All I now think is how many of us are carrying a Chhau goth inside our mind, wherever we go? How do we plan to take ourselves out of that small, narrow and dark Chhau goth?\\n(The author is executive head at SiTL, an NGO working for youths and children)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThere is a wide diversity of sexual orientations among human beings. Ever since I was a teenager, I was always confused about my orientation. As I never felt sexual attraction toward anyone, I used to consider myself an asexual. When I was 21, I happened to be very close to a gentleman, developed an emotional connection, and was surprisingly attracted to him. It was my one-sided attraction that was never reciprocated and thus never turned into a relationship. But this phase of my life helped me identify myself as a demisexual.\\nA demisexual is someone who experiences sexual attraction only after having a strong emotional bond with an individual. After that incident, I could not feel sexually attracted to anyone in my life as I could not develop a strong emotional bond with anyone. Some people with similar orientations feel sexual attraction for only one person in their lives. They never get attracted to other individuals even after being separated from that first person. Other people of demisexual orientation can develop sexual attraction with other individuals if they can develop a strong emotional connection.\\nGrowing up as a demisexual was a slightly different experience for me than that of my conventional heterosexual friends. I was never a part of the groups watching adult movies on weekends in the college hostel. I was never interested in going on romantic dates. I was never fascinated with adult trash talks with my friends. I was more interested in writing poetry, singing, and reading stories. Being a demisexual, I am misunderstood most of the time. The guys whose relationship or marriage proposals I have rejected often call me egoistic, picky, and someone who doesnt respect their feelings toward me. The truth is that I cannot see them with lustful eyes as I dont feel any sexual attraction toward them. Being in a relationship without deep friendship, mental connection, and strong emotional bond is no different than a nightmare.\\nSome people have mistaken my orientation, assuming that I am a disciplined sexual. What they fail in understanding is the difference between a demisexual and a disciplined sexual person.\\nA disciplined sexual can feel sexual attraction to other individuals without emotional bonds but choose not to participate in sexual activities without having an emotional bond first, and they also choose to be loyal with their choice. In the case of a demisexual, the person doesnt have a sexual attraction in the first place if there is no deep emotional connection involved. They are never attracted to physical beauty, appearance, and aesthetics, and thus love at first sight doesnt exist in their dictionary.\\nIf anyone is interested in making a demisexual their life partner, then attractive gifts, dinner dates, flirting etc. are not going to help their cause. Such attempts might even be counter-productive as it might intensify the feeling of aversion.All they can do is start with friendship and let the demisexual individual explore them. Giving enough time in friendship until their emotional bond and friendship gets stronger is the best thing they can do.\\n(The author is a student of architecture at Kantipur International College)',\n",
       " \"\\nSparkles in her eyes, multi-hued. A shine of red, a glint of green, reflections of yellow brightness, light. She holds in her eyes that which fills women and girls with joy.Every morning after her family members eat and go their ways, she heads out with a basket on her head. The fragility of bangles, mirrors, and colors weighs down upon her head as she walks gracefully (in the past bare footed, now slipper-clad), her spine holding straight, her hips swaying gently. She is draped today in a dirt yellow sari, the sash turned turban-like to help her hold the basket in place. As she heads out to the bazaar, her girls have gone the other way--to study, get an education. One had a slight fever and needed medicine, the other had run out of copybooks for college work. They wondered what goodies they would make for snacks when they came back home after studying and made a fuss about what they saw available in the kitchen. Theyll have chicken tomorrow, its Saturday! She reminded them. The Churi Walli smiles as she settles down, placing her ware before her at the street side. Women and girls walking past look down at her basket--the colors, the sparkles take up their eyes and minds. Shovawati, the 55-year-old breadwinner, has kept together her family of 17 selling beauty enhancements. She offers happiness, a sense of self-worth, a daydream out of this world. Shovawati lives in Thulo Ganauria of Suddhodhan Municipality. She was born to parents for whom daughters were a burden. She was born at a time when the society accepted child marriage as a normal and grandparents, matchmakers, and parents made nuptial commitments early on, when girls and boys were still infants. Families at the time were under constant stress regarding the marriage of their daughters. The sooner the knot was tied, the safer their daughters future would be and it was not often that the family had a good idea of what their child was getting into physically or mentally. Such was the world Shovawati was born into. I sell bangles and cosmetic products, things that make women and girls feel good about themselves. I come from a living immersed in traditional values that I sometimes unknowingly try to impose on my daughters. For example, I still think with horror about this marriage Id arranged for my 17-year-old daughter Sasikala!I did not see, I did not see.  But then she did see! A different world. She became associated with SAHAJ and its mothers group. Mentors, peers, counselors talked to her, she talked to them. I had much to do and earning to feed so many people had drained my energy. I had not taken the time to think! Women, mothers, sisters, daughters, daughters-in-law, granddaughters: their rights, their health, their education, their financial independence, their wellbeing, their happiness came up in conversations. During one of the get-togethers of the group, a lawyer came to spend time with them and talked to them about the impact of child marriage.  I was shocked. Shovawati saw herself and her daughter in a different light. She saw her daughter as a victim and herself as the person hurting her. At 17, her piece of heart was still a child, she realized. She saw herself about to put her daughter at high risk to both physical harm and neglect. Early pregnancy would have long-term health effects and she would probably never finish her education, become financially able. The mother and daughter talked, I'd like to complete my education, said Sasikala when she learned of the questions SAHAJ had put in her mothers mind.  I was so happy to hear her say that, Shovawati remembers. Her eyes tear up as she thinks of how close her daughter came to a life that she would perhaps never control. Now, I tell everyone to tell their daughters to study, get a job, learn something that makes them financially able. Tonight Shovawati will count the money she has earned over the day, she will think how fortunate she wants her daughters to be, how she will take care of them and their future so they can take care of themselves forever.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nCan you point out in a doll where respect lies? Is it stored in specific areas of the doll? Does this apply to all humans?\\nFew months ago, a 19-year old girl was raped by a teacher in Doti. At first, he tried to lure her to have sexual relation with him using various incentives but when she did not give in, the teacher started blackmailing her using pictures of a school picnic.\\nThe teacher repeatedly raped the girl by blackmailing. She even got pregnant and had to get an abortion in Kathmandu. The accused was brought to the court in Doti yet he was bailed.\\nWhile the story is saddening on its own what is even more dangerous is that girls like her do not prioritize their safety first. They feel they have a deep sense of responsibility to protect their respect at all cost.\\nRape victims dont open up about their abuse for several years due to the fear of being shamed. In addition, blackmail with pictures and videos have been a cause of suicides and rapes and this is where we need to introspect.\\nWhat if these girls were taught differently? What if girls were not constantly told that their self-worth is in their body? Perhaps, we could have saved them from being raped, reduced their suffering and even prevented them from taking their own lives.\\nKamala Bhasin, an Indian developmental feminist activist, poet, author and founder member of Sangat Organization in an Indian talk-show has said, If I am raped, people say I lost my honor. How did I lose my honor? Who kept my honor in my vagina? Its the rapist who loses respect, not the woman who is raped.\\nWe should teach girls that their honor and respect dont lie inside their bodies or on the body parts as she rightfully mentions. The society widely holds women accountable for their respect, their familys respect and respect of their whole community.\\nHowever, everyone should try to understand that girls and women are not a vacant pot to keep dignity of everyone including themselves nor do they need to carry a mountain of prestige everywhere. In an age where they are sexualized every day, they need to stop believing that their body is a temple of worship.\\nWe need to make it abundantly clear that respect and honor is not tattooed in their skin, muscles and bones. So, if they happen to be sexually violated or blackmailed for their pictures and videos to be leaked on the social media, they will not feel ashamed and consider taking their life.\\nThis way even if girls participate in showing some skin, the society cannot map their character like tanned marks on their skin after exposure to the sunlight.\\nMoreover, the victims would not be blamed for the violence against them pointing at their 'exposed' bodies. Only if they know in their hearts that their pride is intact and it cannot be taken away so easily, they would open up about how they were violated and talk about the perpetrators. They would possibly report crimes more often if they know that they matter more than their image in the public.\\nWe cant risk any more lives due to embedded societal convictions placed on a girl from a young age. We cant let them grow up believing that their bodies can be a medium of shame as it easily translates to saying their own bodies can become their enemy.\\nIts high time that girls unlearn conventional beliefs and relearn necessary values of putting themselves first. They should internalize that they as an individual are inherently valuable and that their safety not their social position is paramount.\\nLooking at the trends of how girls and women are shamed for being raped, sexually harassed and assaulted, this mindset that their private parts are an epitome of respect needs to change.\\nLets teach everyone again on respect starting with every girl child.\",\n",
       " '\\nLesson 1\\nWe often share jokes about wives. The joke could be about how she is \"bossy\" or how she works, her routine, looks, the time she takes to get ready, etc. We laugh and forget all about it.\\nHowever, take a look at what we are actually doing:\\n\\nWe are telling the younger boys on the group that it is okay to shame and demean women. You might ask how? We are telling them it is okay to call women names and complain about the several things mentioned above. They dont comprehend these as jokes. We are shaping the young boy to grow up and make jokes about the female figures in his life (could be his mom, partner, aunt, etc.). Are you okay with your little boy doing this?\\nWe are telling the younger girls that it is okay to be treated like this. We are normalizing this situation for her. How? When a girl reads a joke, she automatically associates it to her mom, aunt, any female relative, who she looks up to. And she is picking up that it is okay to be treated like that and being called names. Would you like your daughter to be treated like this by her in-laws? Or even her siblings and other members of the family?\\nWe are teaching both boys and girls that women (youngsters quickly associate the joke with their moms or any relative) are inferior or cunningly evil.\\nSome of those who are aware and feel awful about such jokes remain silent. How is this harmful? You teach your child it is okay to not stand up for women (whether a girl or a boy). You are normalizing the perception that women are inferior.\\n\\nLesson 2\\nAnother sign of misogyny is the words we use to describe the same situation for a male and female.\\n\\nWhile a man is decisive, a woman is bossy.\\nA man can be authoritative and charismatic, but a woman is shrill.\\nWhen a man is smart and talkative, we say the exact same words, \"smart and talkative\" but for a woman \"kainchi jaisi zubaan.\"\\nA man would be called a leader, but a woman is a \"ballbreaker\".\\nWhen a man pushes his point, he is \"persistent\" while a woman is \"nagging.\"\\nWhy do we describe a man who expresses his emotions as a little girl? How is that supposed to be an insult? Dont be a girl is often used to describe men who express emotions.\\n\\nWhy do we use different terminology? How are the two different? Why should we have to use derogatory words for women and positive comments for men?\\nPlease refrain from doing this, whether around your child or not. You are creating a mentally toxic environment for both genders and are degrading women.\\nLesson 3\\nHow would you feel if your child is body/color shaming in public? Not good, embarrassed. You will probably ask yourself; how did my child learn that?\\nYou dont realize that you are the reason.\\n\\nYou share jokes and memes about the appearance of people, and females especially. Such supposed jokes are titled \"Who will marry her?\" or something even more insulting.\\nWhen looking for a \"bahu\", you prioritize fair-skinned and slim girls.\\n\\nWho gave you the right to make comments about anybodys body? When you do this around your child, s/he thinks it is okay to make such snarky comments. You are also creating an unhealthy environment for a young girl who will have complexes about the way she looks. Do you think it is right? For you, it might be a joke. For someone else, it could be her/ his whole life. Instead of focusing on petty things such as her looks, look into her education, hobbies, career, etc.\\nLesson 4\\nNow reflect upon the upbringing of your children or someone who you have known closely. There is a massive difference between how we bring up a boy and a girl. I will choose just two examples, but I am sure you will have many more to share.\\n\\nCooking- Why are girls told from the very beginning that she must know how to cook? When looking for a bahu, knowing how to cook is a prerequisite. However, have you ever encouraged your boy to learn how to cook? Probably not. I am not saying stop encouraging your girls to cook. What I am saying is, start encouraging your boys. Cooking is essential for survival. Stop gender stereotyping the role of a cook. A man should know how to cook and survive through.\\nOffice- Why are young boys asked to start visiting the office at an early age, but girls have to \"prove\" themselves before stepping in? Why do you ask your little boy to accompany his dad while the girl is usually helping her mom with chores? Do you think because women are less competent? Or do you not want your daughter or any female to be independent? Are you scared she will be better? Or are you waiting to get her married off? Why are women looked as somebodys liabilities all the time? She is never her own person. First, she is her fathers daughter and then her husbands wife. Where is her own identity?\\n\\nConclusion\\nWhile your joke has no hard intentions, it is doing more damage than one can think of. Now, this\\nis a problem. The anecdote easily converts or influences the mindset of the society (or is rather a result of the mentality of the community). Rape, sexual harassment, domestic abuse, dowry deaths and other crimes against women are a result of this inferior thought process toward women.\\nThe above issues are a classic example of misogyny. Misogyny in the 21st century is turning into messages and jokes. Women are easily and more often than not accused by the \\'peacemakers\\' when she complains about abuse at home. She is expected to \"accept\" her life. We quickly question her character, level of patience, what she is doing to serve her husband, etc., even when the actual issue may be about the misdeeds on the part of the man/husband.\\nInstead of demeaning women, it would be better to share jokes, articles, posts which are more respectful toward women. This will help nurture the future generations and accept women for who they are. It will create a better, ethical and equitable attitude in life. Men should learn that women are people who deserve respect and dignitytheir opinion, decisions, complaints and consent matter. This change will only materialize when we begin changing our lifestyle and upbringing.\\nI hope by now, you have pretty much understood what I am trying to explain. Reflect on your behavior and stop discrimination. A light joke and remark can shape a child\\'s future, and the circle of patriarchy will be never-ending. Ask yourself how you want the generations to come to treat the female figures in his/her life. And women, start standing up for yourselves. You might be financially dependent on your husband, but do you want the same dependence for your daughter? Also, never be afraid to ask for being treated right. Your reliance on your husband doesn\\'t allow him to demean and insult you. His entire household depends on you. Never forget that.',\n",
       " '\\nWhenever I read about rapes, there is this wrenching pain in my heart with twisting and twirling of my abdomen, tears all over my eyes and my body totally numb. I take every rape related news very personally not because I have had a similar experience in life but because I think if someone decides to rape me I\\'ll be raped. I am scared that I might be just another story someday. While sharing these infuriating thoughts with one of my closest friends he scoffed and asked me \"You need to stop viewing world with the lens of feminism. You are not a victim, your ranting isn\\'t changing anything. Tell me what you can do?\"\\nIf I have to rant, I might rant on how unfair it is for us to feel threatened just to get out of our house not only at night but also in broad daylight. I would rant about how my choice of clothes determines my character. Meanwhile, I see men in shorts and sleeveless T-shirts and yet don\\'t get aroused or tempted by their skin. That\\'s probably because men do not have shiny and hairless skin like us? Or maybe because I have basic respect for another human\\'s body, and choices. I would rant about how men shift their gaze from my eyes to my neck and fixate them over my chest while we share our thoughts. I would rant about all those times when I was groped publicly and asked to not get into public bus if my body is that fragile when I raised my voice. I would rant about my senior who mistook me drinking with him as a signal. But I don\\'t rant about these. My expectations from men have fallen so low that I have accepted \"men will be men\\'. So, whenever I meet a guy who treats women like human instead of an object I automatically think him to be the best man possible but all he is doing is behaving as human as possible.\\nWhat can I do? I cannot complain and not find a solution, can I?\\nFirst and foremost what is our source of knowledge about sex? Is it from the curriculum books or from packages we get over the internet? How many of us were taught reproductive health chapters in our biology classes without hesitation? I remember my science teacher skipping that chapter like it doesn\\'t exist. Are we open about sex and intimacy with people who are younger than us? Are parents considering sitting with their younger ones and having the tough, uncomfortable talk? How exactly are teens being educated about sex? Sex education is one of the most important factors here which not only educates the younger ones but also resolves their curious queries. In age of experiments and curiosity, we see our youngsters tempting over anything that\\'s reckless. While teaching about sex and human anatomy, one should be taught that sex happens between two and it is basic need for human irrespective of any sex. Teaching minors about touch and how to differentiate between the good touch and the bad touch is very essential. Certain areas of body which are private and no one should have an acess to them.\\nWe as a society, a patriarchial society, hold our daughters with rules and regulations, and invest pride, dignity of her, her family and society over the organ between her legs. How and why is it fair that the organ that enables a woman to push a new life out of her also makes her the most vulnerable? Is being a woman and having the organ and being blessed with the ability to conceive and give birth not a power of strength? But why does the same organ make her vulnerable and signifies her character? Being raped isn\\'t her choice but raping is his choice. So why do we always accuse the victim and leave the rapist off the hook? When will we stop to put the character, dignity and pride of whole family on the fragile shoulders of our daughters? Should we not hold our son responsible instead of condoning him? We need to teach our daughters and sisters that they can go out and conquer the world and we will stick for each other no matter what. We need to teach our sons and brothers that women are not for objectification and treat them as human as possiblle\\nRape happens between closed doors, mostly from people we have known or our confidants. Rapists do not have some different identity. They live among us and may be our father, uncle, brother, brother-in-law, or cousin. The rapist usually rapes because he is confident enough that the crime is usually brushed under the carpet: like nothing happened and nothing has changed. We put so much of pride over the fragile organ between our legs that most of the times the victim never opens up. The audacity of rapists increases with the practice of victim-blaming, witch-hunting and blaming the clothes.\\nWhatever I drape myself in, I know if someone decides to rape, I\\'ll be raped. It\\'s not my cloth. My cloth was never an issue. It\\'s society we live in that gives women a position of goddess yet treat her on the basis of the organ. It\\'s not our organ that makes us vulnerable. It\\'s the people shaped by patriarchy that makes us vulnerable. Will society digest if I decide to lead a happy life forgetting the wounds of past? Imagine not putting the entire dignity and pride over an organ, and punishing the victim, giving women equal rights and freedom. Can you imagine a better world? Can you imagine the world where women decide her worth and not her vagina?',\n",
       " '\\nNepal Sambat is one of the national calendars of Nepal traditionally associated with the Newa community and the Kathmandu Valley. It has, for the past 1,140 years, been a lunar-based calendar but recently, efforts have been made to introduce a solar calendar to bring uniformity and regularity. This year, a solar calendar was devised and released by activists which has come into effect from October 20. But, perhaps, it was a solution to an issue that nobody thought was a problem.\\nNepal Sambat has been following its lunar roots for a long time and all the celebrations of festivals have followed the same calendar system ever since their inception. This means that Nepal Sambat (NS) calendar follows the phases of the moon as a basis of determining the date. This is also popularly known as panchanga or tithi system. Unlike the solar calendars, lunar calendars have been found to be very irregular, the cause of which may be because they do not follow the leap day system and instead rely on a leap-month system. Since NS is based on this system, the New Years Day for it (Nhu dan) has been usually celebrated on the day of Mha Puja in the Newa community. This has always been a problem for many people who want to tie some event to a certain NS date, but since it keeps fluctuating, it can be highly unreliable for official usage.\\nA solution to this problem has recently been proposed by a few enthusiasts, which involves the adoption of the solar calendar system instead of the lunar counterpart, so that the dates become more regular. This may be seen as a great solution for the particular problem but it might in fact come as a potential problem for the Newa community that relies on the lunar calendar system to follow certain festivals. October 20 has been marked as the New Years Day for NS 1140, which creates a plethora of problems and disputes related to when these festivals should be celebrated.\\nTaking a look at how the lunar calendar system came to be the official calendar for celebrating most Newa festivals, it seems that it is the calendar system which is most in line with the seasons. This might have become so as a result of the agricultural past of the Newa community. In the past, the Newa community was a self-sustaining one where people were given different occupations based on their skills, which was passed down for generations. This also included agriculture and farming as a profession. Nepal experiences four major seasons, which made it a necessity for the farmers to majorly cultivate and produce seasonal crops. This is why it is no surprise that a few crops and dishes are prepared and consumed only on particular occasions and seasons; when the crops would have been harvested. For example, quati is a soup which consists of nine beans and lentils, is highly nutritious and helps in boosting the immune system of the human body. This is only prepared on Gum Punhi/Janai Purnima by the Newa community, which is exactly when these beans and lentils would have been harvested and produced in the past.\\nIn todays modern world, people no longer need to wait for a certain occasion because of the boom of trade and there is no necessity for a self-sustaining community. However, if we look at the NS calendar predicted by the astrologers, they are still seen to be more in line with the seasons than the solar calendars, despite the effects of climate change and global warming. This knowledge of the lunar calendar is what our ancestors had left us with, and is what we base our festivals on. Changing this to a solar calendar may not be accepted by the general population because it cannot incorporate such events. A solution for this may be to incorporate the NS dates on the basis of the solar calendar but celebrate the festivals based on the lunar calendar. This seems to be the most viable solution for this problem.\\nHowever, Nepal already has its own luni-solar calendar, Bikram Sambat. Having to juggle between the Gregorian solar calendar and the Bikram Sambat alongside the lunar Nepal Sambat sounds complicated enough, so why would the general public want to adapt to the solar NS anyway? It brings nothing new to the table for the common man except additional unnecessary confusion. The step taken to establish NS as a mainstream official calendar is a welcome one, but to the eye of a common person, it may look like the solution to a problem that never existed and one that creates more confusion. To the person, it looks like a plot to rob him/her of his/her culture by making an unauthentic version of NS, official in the name of conservation of cultural heritage.\\nThere have always been people who have asked to make the NS the mainstream calendar for official use because other calendars do not incorporate all the festivals and occasions, but removing the festival element just to incorporate it as mainstream seems like an unwanted solution that defeats the original purpose. It may not be the most practical thing to implement NS as a mainstream calendar because it is very irregular. However, its original lunar version can be made the official calendar for festivals as a way to make it mainstream and as a step to conserve the culture that has been passed down by our ancestors. It makes more sense to do this as Bikram Sambat also has a lunar aspect already associated with it.\\nTaking all of the information into account, many people may not accept the solar NS calendar even if it gets the official green flag. This may create a dispute in the near future among the people in our Newa community which is the exact opposite of the original purpose of establishing a solar NS. The Newa community today seems to be very confused and hence divided when it comes to conserving the culture that has been passed down as some of it may not be largely practical in the modern world. The best way to move forward seems to be to compromise among the old values and replacing impractical ones with new values, but for most people from the older generation, change is not very acceptable and hence results in a divide in the mostly unified Newa community. This is the reason solar NS might be unacceptable for many Newa people.\\n(Tuladhar is a data science student at Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand)',\n",

       " '\\nTwitter has threatened legal action against Meta over its new, text-based app called Threads, according to a letter obtained by Semafor.\\nIn a Wednesday letter addressed to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Alex Spiro, an attorney representing Twitter, accused Meta of unlawfully using Twitters trade secrets and other intellectual property by hiring former Twitter employees to create a copycat app.\\nSince launching Threads Wednesday night, Metas new app has collected tens of millions of sign ups. The app, which was created by the companys Instagram team, arrives at a time when many are looking for Twitter alternatives to escape Elon Musks raucous oversight of the platform since acquiring it last year for $44 billion.\\nMeta spokesperson Andy Stone responded to the report of Spiros letter on Threads Thursday afternoon, writing, no one on the Threads engineering team is a former Twitter employee  thats just not a thing.\\nIn the letter, which Semafor first reported on Thursday, Spiro said that Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights  and noted the companys right to seek civil remedies or injunctive relief. He added that the letter marked a formal notice for Meta to preserve documents relevant for a potential dispute between the companies.\\nThe Associated Press reached out to Spiro and Twitter on Thursday for further information. Twitter responded to an email seeking comment with a poop emoji, its standard automated response to reporters.\\nMusk hasnt directly tweeted about the possibility of legal action, but he has replied to several snarky takes on the Threads launch. The Twitter owner responded to one tweet suggesting that Metas app was built largely through the use of the copy and paste function, with a laughing emoji.\\nTwitter CEO Linda Yaccarino has also not publicly commented on Wednesdays letter, but seemingly appeared to address Threads launch in a Thursday tweet.\\nWere often imitated -- but the Twitter community can never be duplicated, Yaccarino wrote.\\nStill, some analysts say Metas new app could be a significant headache for Twitter  pointing to the excitement surrounding Threads launch and impressive download numbers so far.\\nSuccess for the app isnt guaranteed, of course. Industry watchers point to Metas track record of starting standalone apps that were later shut down, for example, and note that Threads is still in its early days  so time will tell.\\nMetas new app has also raised data privacy concerns. While Threads launched in more than 100 countries Wednesday, it is notably unavailable in the European Union, which has strict data privacy rules.',\n",

Early celebrity users include chef Gordon Ramsay, the pop star Shakira and Mark Hoyle, better known as the YouTuber LadBaby.\\nUsers get a Twitter-like microblogging experience, according to screenshots provided to media, suggesting that Meta Platforms has been gearing up to directly challenge the platform after Musks tumultuous ownership has resulted in a series of unpopular changes that have turned off users and advertisers.\\nThere are buttons to like, repost, reply to or quote a thread, and counters showing the number of likes and replies that a post has received.\\nOur vision is that Threads will be a new app more focused on text and dialogue, modeled after what Instagram has done for photo and video, the company said.\\nPosts are limited to 500 characters, which is more than Twitters 280-character threshold, and can include links, photos and videos up to five minutes long.\\nInstagram users will be able to log in with their existing usernames and follow the same accounts on the new app. New users will have to set up an Instagram account.\\nMeta emphasized measures to keep users safe, including enforcing Instagrams community guidelines and providing tools to control who can mention or reply to users.\\nMetas new offering, however, has raised data privacy concerns.\\nThreads could collect a wide range of personal information, including health, financial, contacts, browsing and search history, location data, purchases and sensitive info, according to its data privacy disclosure on the App Store.\\nTwitter co-founder Jack Dorsey pointed it out in a snarky tweet saying, All your Threads are belong to us that included a screenshot of the disclosure. Musk replied yeah.\\nOne place Threads wont be rolled out is in the European Union, which has strict data privacy rules.\\nMeta has informed Irelands Data Privacy Commission that it has no plans yet to launch Threads in the 27-nation bloc, commission spokesman Graham Doyle said. The Irish watchdog is Metas main privacy regulator for the EU because the companys regional headquarters is based in Dublin.\\n\\nWhile Meta had teased Threads with a listing on Apples U.K. App Store earlier this week, it could not be found in the French, German or Dutch versions. The company is working on rolling the app out to more countries but cites regulatory uncertainty for its decision to hold off on a European launch.\\nAnalysts said its success is far from guaranteed, citing Metas track record of starting standalone apps that were later shut down.\\nAlso in question is whether its the right move for Meta, which has announced tens of thousands of layoffs over the past year amid a tech industry slowdown.\\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg also has been focusing on the metaverse, investing tens of billions of dollars in the virtual reality concept.\\nMeta risks spreading itself too thin, said Mike Proulx, a research director at Forrester, a global market research company. Meta is banking on a moment in time amidst peak Twitter frustration. However, this window of opportunity is already flooded with Twitter alternatives including Bluesky, Mastodon, Spill, Post.News and Hive, which are all competing for Twitters market share.\\nEven so, Threads could be a fresh headache for Musk, who acquired Twitter last year for $44 billion.\\nHes made a series of changes that have triggered backlash, the latest being daily limits on the number of tweets people can view to try to stop unauthorized scraping of potentially valuable data. He also is now requiring paid verification for users to access the online dashboard TweetDeck.\\nMusks rivalry with Zuckerberg could end up spilling over into real life. In an online exchange the two tech billionaires seemingly agreed to a cage match face-off, though its unclear if they will actually make it to the ring.',\n",

Meta declined to comment on the app.\\nMusk replied yeah to a tweet from Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey saying, All your Threads are belong to us, along with a screenshot from the App Stores privacy section showing what personal information might be collected by the new Meta app.\\nThreads could be the latest headache for Musk, who acquired Twitter last year for $44 billion and has been making changes that have unnerved advertisers and turned off users, including new daily limits on the number of tweets people can view.\\nMeta has good timing because Twitter users are growing frustrated with Musks changes and looking for a viable alternative, said Matt Navarra, a social media consultant.\\nThreads presents the opportunity to jump to a platform that can give them many of the things that they want Twitter to continue to be that it no longer is, he said.\\nAllowing Instagram users to port their profile to Threads could give the new app more traction with potential users by providing a ready-made set of accounts for them to follow, said Navarra, former director of social media at tech news site The Next Web and digital communications adviser for the British government.\\nTwitter has rolled out a series of unpopular changes in recent days, including a requirement for users to be verified to use the online dashboard TweetDeck. The policy announced Monday takes effect in 30 days and appears to be aimed at raising extra revenue because users need to pay have their accounts verified under Musks changes.\\nTweetDeck is popular with companies and news organizations, allowing users to manage multiple Twitter accounts.\\nIt comes after outcry over Musks announcement this weekend that Twitter has limited the number of tweets users can view each day  restrictions that the billionaire Tesla CEO described as an attempt to stop unauthorized scraping of potentially valuable data.\\nStill, some users might be put off by Metas data privacy track record, Navarra said. And would-be Twitter challengers like Mastodon have found it a challenge to sign up users.\\nIts hard to tell whether the upset and discontent is strong enough to make a mass exodus or whether it will be somewhat of a slow erosion, Navarra said.\\nMusks rivalry with Meta Platforms also could end up spilling over into real life. In an online exchange between Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the two tech billionaires seemingly agreed to a cage match face-off, though its unclear if they will actually make it to the ring.',\n",
       " '\\nThe Taliban are banning womens beauty salons in Afghanistan, a government spokesman said Tuesday.\\nIts the latest curb on the rights and freedoms of Afghan women and girls, following edicts barring them from education, public spaces and most forms of employment.\\nA spokesman for the Taliban-run Virtue and Vice Ministry, Mohammad Sidik Akif Mahajar, didnt give details of the ban. He only confirmed the contents of a letter circulating on social media.\\nThe ministry-issued letter, dated June 24, says it conveys a verbal order from the supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada. The ban targets the capital, Kabul, and all provinces, and gives salons throughout the country a months notice to wind down their businesses. After that period, they must close and submit a report about their closure. The letter doesnt give reasons for the ban.\\nIts release comes days after Akhundzada claimed that his government has taken the necessary steps for the betterment of womens lives in Afghanistan.\\nIt drew criticism from human and womens rights defenders on social media.\\nThe United Nations on Tuesday also said it was engaged with the authorities in Afghanistan to get the ban on beauty salons reversed. The U.N. mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA, took to Twitter, urging the Taliban to halt the edict.\\nThis new restriction on womens rights will impact negatively on the economycontradicts stated support for women entrepreneurship, it said.\\nEarlier, one beauty salon owner said she was her familys only breadwinner after her husband died in a 2017 car bombing. She didnt want to be named or mention her salon for fear of reprisals.\\nBetween eight to 12 women visit her Kabul salon every day, she said.\\nDay by day they (the Taliban) are imposing limitations on women, she told The Associated Press. Why are they only targeting women? Arent we human? Dont we have the right to work or live?\\nDespite initial promises of a more moderate rule than during their previous stint in power in the 1990s, the Taliban have imposed harsh measures since seizing Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces were pulling out.\\nThey have barred women from public spaces, like parks and gyms, and cracked down on media freedoms. The measures have triggered a fierce international uproar, increasing the countrys isolation at a time when its economy has collapsed  and have worsened a humanitarian crisis.',\n",
       " '\\nPresident Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that the Russian people are united as never before, seeking to project confidence in the wake of a short-lived revolt while participating in a meeting of an international organization that offered him a sympathetic audience.\\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting, hosted via videoconference by India, was Putins first multilateral summit since an armed rebellion rattled Russia and comes as he is eager to show the West has failed to isolate Moscow over its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\\nThe Asian security grouping, founded by Russia and China to counter Western alliances, also welcomed Iran as a new member, bringing its membership to nine nations.\\nSpeaking by video link from the Kremlin, Putin praised the organization for playing an increasingly significant role in international affairs, making a real contribution to maintaining peace and stability, ensuring sustainable economic growth of the participating states, and strengthening ties between peoples.\\nHe thanked the member states for supporting Russian authorities during the short-lived mutiny mounted by Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, and said the West had turned Ukraine into a virtually hostile state  anti-Russia. Putin has frequently lashed out at the West for its support of Ukraine in the war.\\nThe summit presented an opportunity for Putin to show he remains in control after the insurrection left some wondering about divisions among Russian elites.\\nThe Russian people are united as never before, he said. The solidarity and responsibility for the fate of the fatherland was clearly demonstrated by the Russian political circles and the entire society by standing as a united front against the attempted armed rebellion.\\nEarlier speakers avoided direct references to the war, while bemoaning its global consequences.\\nA declaration adopted at the virtual summit also made no reference to Ukraine, but it said threats and challenges are ``becoming more and more complex, destructive and dangerous, existing conflicts are aggravating and new conflicts are emerging.\\nIn his opening speech, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned of global challenges to food, fuel and fertilizer supplies but didnt mention the war in Ukraine. Trade in all three has been disrupted by the war.\\nHe also took a veiled swipe at Pakistan, saying the group shouldnt hesitate to criticize countries that are using terrorism as an instrument of its state policy.\\nTerrorism poses a threat to regional peace and we need to take up a joint fight, Modi said without naming Pakistan. India regularly accuses Pakistan of training and arming insurgent groups, a charge that Islamabad denies.\\nIn his speech, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced terrorism and defended his countrys role in the fight against it.\\nWhile the sacrifices made by Pakistan in fighting terrorism are without parallel, this scourge continues to plague our region and remains a serious obstacle to the maintenance of peace and stability, Sharif said. Any temptation to use it as a cudgel for diplomatic point scoring must be eschewed.\\nSharif also hailed the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, part of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, saying it could be a game changer for connectivity, stability, peace and prosperity in the region.\\nSix of the nine SCO members  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan  reaffirmed their support for the BRI initiative, the declaration said.\\nIndia opposes the initiative because it is being built through a portion of Kashmir under the control of Pakistan that New Delhi considers to be included in its part of the divided territory.\\nThe declaration calls for new approaches to promote more equitable and effective international cooperation. It also said the SCO is not directed against any other states and is open to broad cooperation with all.\\nIt said the ``principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity of states, non-interference in internal affairs and non-use of force or threats to use force, are the basis of sustainable development of international relations.\\nThe SCO includes the four Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, all former Soviet republics in which Russian influence runs deep. India and Pakistan became members in 2017. Belarus is also in line for membership.\\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi said that the benefits of the official membership of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the SCO will be historic.\\nRaisis speech, cited by the Iranian news agency IRNA, expressed the hope that membership will prepare the ground for improving collective security, respect for the sovereignty of member nations, sustainable development, and confronting environmental threats.\\nU.N. Secretary-General Antnio Guterres said in a message that the summit was taking place amid growing global challenges and risks.\\nBut at a time when the world needs to work together, divisions are growing, and geopolitical tensions are rising, he said.\\nThese differences have been aggravated by several factors: diverging approaches to global crises; contrasting views on nontraditional security threats; and, of course, the consequences of COVID-19 and Russias invasion of Ukraine, he said.\\nChinese President Xi Jinping called on members to work toward long-term peace and stability in the region, according to a readout of his speech posted by state broadcaster CCTV.\\nHe said China wants to better synergize the countrys Belt and Road Initiative  a trillion-dollar infrastructure investment project criticized in the West for burdening smaller countries with large amounts of debt  with other nations own development strategies and regional cooperation initiatives.\\nEven as the SCO continues to expand, the group remains at risk of competing interests or conflicts between member states.\\nIndia and Pakistan share a history of bitter relations, mainly over Kashmir, a disputed Himalayan region that is split between them but claimed by both in its entirety, and they have fought two wars over it.\\nMeanwhile, New Delhi and Beijing are locked in a three-year standoff of thousands of soldiers stationed along their disputed border in the eastern Ladakh region.\\nAnd the SCO summit took place as Moscow relies more deeply on Beijing as its war in Ukraine drags on. While New Delhi has avoided criticizing Russias invasion, Moscows China ties could irk India in the long run and complicate its relationship with Cold War ally Russia.',\n",
       " '\\nAirstrikes targeting Palestinian militants in a crowded residential area. Armored bulldozers plowing through narrow streets, crushing cars and piling up debris. Protesters burning tires. A mounting death toll.\\nIsraels large-scale military raid into the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Monday had undeniable similarities with the second Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s  a period that claimed thousands of lives.\\nBut the current fighting is also different from those intense years of violence. Its more limited in scope, with Israeli military operations focused on several strongholds of Palestinian militants.\\nIts also a symptom of a conflict with no foreseeable end. The Palestinian leadership is weakened, and the Israeli government has been accelerating the expansion of settlements that have eroded any chance of Palestinian statehood.\\nWHAT IS AN INTIFADA?\\nThe word that means shaking off in Arabic was coined to describe an uprising against Israels military occupation that erupted in 1987. It ended in 1993 with an agreement of mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.\\nWhat became known as the first intifada was marked by widespread Palestinian protests and a fierce Israeli response. In the second uprising, which began in 2000, Palestinian militants carried out deadly suicide bombings on buses and at restaurants and hotels, eliciting crushing Israeli military reprisals.\\nThe second uprising pitted Palestinian militant groups against a far more powerful Israeli military. Over 4,000 people died, including vast numbers of civilians. Roughly three times as many Palestinians as Israelis were killed.\\nIsrael struck targets in a militant stronghold in the occupied West Bank with drones and deployed hundreds of troops in the area, in an incursion that resembled the wide-scale military operations carried out during the second Palestinian uprising two decades ago. Palestinian health officials said at least eight Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded.\\nIsraeli crackdowns upended Palestinian lives, including placing tight restrictions on movement that choked the fledgling economy. For Israelis, especially during the frequent bombings of the second intifada, stepping onto a bus or going out to a restaurant was terrifying.\\nThose events were initially fueled by widespread participation. Many Palestinians in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem  areas captured by Israel in 1967 and claimed by the Palestinians for their state  joined in the protests.\\nThe protests were also driven by the Palestinian leaders, including President Yasser Arafat, whom Israel accused of encouraging and abetting militants. The intifada petered out after Arafat died in 2004 and the current Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, took power.\\nWHAT IS HAPPENING NOW?\\nIn the spring of 2022, a spate of Palestinian attacks against Israelis prompted Israel to launch near-nightly raids into Palestinian areas of the West Bank.\\nIsrael said the raids were meant to stamp out militant networks. But Palestinian attacks have continued, and the death toll on both sides has risen, making last year one of the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since the second intifada.\\nThe violence has only intensified since Israels current far-right government, which is made up of hard-line ultranationalist settlement supporters, took power late last year.\\nThe Palestinian death toll this year in the West Bank and east Jerusalem stands at more than 135, according to a tally by The Associated Press, nearly matching the death toll for all of 2022. Hundreds of Palestinians have been arrested. Some 24 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis.\\nSIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES\\nThe region has not seen such a sustained cycle of violence since the second uprising, which lasted about five years. More recent periods of bloodshed have not lasted this long or involved such a strong show of force by the military.\\nThe tactics seen Monday, with airstrikes, armored bulldozers and a brigade of troops, were a mainstay of the second uprising.\\nBut analysts say thats where the similarities end.\\nFor one, a monthlong Israeli operation in 2002 that was seen as the peak of the fighting during the second intifada involved an intense clampdown on most cities in the West Bank. Israels raids over the last year have been smaller in scale. Israels targets are also more limited to local armed groups and militant cells.\\nOther differences, analysts say, include the weakened Palestinian leadership and the lack of popular participation. While protests have erupted in response to the raids, they have not engulfed the entire West Bank.\\nIntifada is a peoples uprising. Its a society that fights, said Amir Avivi, president and founder of Israel Defense and Security Forum, a hawkish group of former military commanders. Avivi, who served as a battalion commander in the northern West Bank during the 2002 operation, claimed that the current fighting is dominated by militant groups that are funded by Israels archenemy, Iran.\\nZiyad Abu Zayad, a Palestinian analyst and former Cabinet minister, said the fighting is best described as waves of Palestinian anger, not an uprising.\\nThe problem is not security, but rather political. And as long as there is no political solution, these waves will continue, he said. People, mainly young people, want to live in freedom and dignity. They see no future for themselves, and they only see oppression from the occupation.\\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\\nThere is no end in sight to the fighting. The military raids have tended to fuel more attacks that prompt even more raids.\\nAs attacks against Israelis have mounted, including one that killed four settlers last month, government members have called for a harsher response. They have also intensively advanced settlement building, further dimming hopes for a negotiated solution to the conflict.\\nThe last 16 months, including Mondays large-scale raid, showed Israel lacks a long-term vision for how to deal with the Palestinians, said Michael Milshtein, a former military official and head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University.\\nWe need to start thinking strategically about the Palestinian issue, he said. We cant just keep plastering over it.\\nAbu Zayad, the Palestinian analyst, said Israels government is instead pushing the Palestinians toward more extremism and violence.\\nIf there is opposition to the idea of a Palestinian state, these waves are likely to remain for long periods to come.',\n",

We want to calm things down.\\nShe said she was angry at the officer who killed her grandson but not at the police in general and expressed faith in the justice system as France faces its worst social upheaval in years. Her grandson, identified by only his first name, was buried on Saturday.\\nThe violence appeared to be lessening. Still, the office of Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said 45,000 police officers would again be deployed in the streets to counter anger over discrimination against people who trace their roots to former French colonies and live in low-income neighborhoods. Nahel is of Algerian descent and was shot in the Paris suburb of Nanterre.\\nPresident Emmanuel Macron held a special security meeting Sunday night and plans to meet Monday with the heads of both houses of parliament and Tuesday with the mayors of 220 towns and cities affected by the protests, said a participant in the meeting, who spoke anonymously in line with French government practices. Macron also wants to start a detailed, longer-term assessment of the reasons that led to the unrest, the official said.\\nHighlighting the seriousness of the rioting, Macron has delayed what would have been the first state visit to Germany by a French president in 23 years, which had been scheduled to start Sunday evening.\\nThe interior ministry said police made 49 arrests nationwide Sunday, French media reported, down significantly from 719 arrests the day before. More than 3,000 people have been detained overall following a mass security deployment. Hundreds of police and firefighters have been injured in the violence, although authorities havent said how many protesters have been hurt.\\nFrench authorities were appalled on Sunday after a burning car struck the home of the mayor of the Paris suburb of LHay-les-Roses. Several police stations and town halls have been targeted by fires or vandalism in recent days, but such a personal attack on a mayors home is unusual.\\nMayor Vincent Jeanbrun said his wife and one of his children were injured in the 1:30 a.m. attack while they slept and he was in the town hall monitoring the violence. Jeanbrun, of the conservative opposition Republicans party, said the attack represented a new stage of horror and ignominy in the unrest.\\nRegional prosecutor Stephane Hardouin opened an investigation into attempted murder, telling French television that a preliminary investigation suggests the car was meant to ram the house and set it ablaze. He said a flame accelerant was found in a bottle in the car.\\nMacron has blamed social media for fueling violence. Frances justice minister has warned that young people who share calls for violence on Snapchat or other apps could face prosecution.\\nThe mass police deployment has been welcomed by some frightened residents of targeted neighborhoods, but it has further frustrated those who see police behavior as the core of the crisis.\\nOn a public square in Nanterre, a young man of Senegalese descent said France would learn little from the latest unrest. Faiez Njai said of police: Theyre playing on our fears, saying that If you dont listen to us,  and then he pointed a finger at his temple and fired.\\nVideo of the killing showed two officers at the window of the car, one with his gun pointed at the driver. As the teenager pulled forward, the officer fired once through the windshield. The officer accused of killing Nahel was given a preliminary charge of voluntary homicide.\\nThirteen people who didnt comply with traffic stops were fatally shot by French police last year, and three this year, prompting demands for more accountability.\\nNahel M.s death first reflects the rules and practices for how police officers use weapons during roadside checks and, more broadly, the flawed relations between the police and young people from working-class neighborhoods, the newspaper Le Monde said in an editorial on Saturday.\\nAmid the unrest, a World War II monument in Nanterre commemorating Holocaust victims and members of the French resistance was vandalized on the sidelines of a silent march Thursday to pay tribute to Nahel. The slogans included Dont forgive or forget and Police, rapists, assassins. The European Jewish Congress denounced the vandalism as a shameful act of disrespect for the memory of the victims of the Holocaust.\\nLife in some parts of France went on as usual. In the capital, tourists thronged to the Eiffel Tower, where workers set up a nearby clock counting down to next years Paris Olympics. A short walk from Nanterre, a shopping mall bustled Sunday with customers from all walks of life. But in the empty square where Nahel was shot, someone had painted The police kill on a bench.\\nAt the foot of a bridge near the Eiffel Tower where generations of couples have attached padlocks to symbolize lasting love, a Senegalese man selling cheap locks and keys shook his head when asked if Nahels killing and the ensuing violence would change anything.\\nI doubt it, he said, giving only his first name, Demba, for fear of retaliation. The discrimination is too profound.',\n",

It was the first such attack of the war in 12 days.\\nAll of the Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones were detected and shot down, according to Serhii Popko, the head of the Kyiv city administration. In addition to the city itself, the surrounding Kyiv region was targeted. Kyiv regional Gov. Ruslan Kravchenko reported that one person was wounded by falling debris from a destroyed drone.\\nOfficials in the Ukrainian capital didnt provide an exact number of drones that attacked the city. But Ukraines air force said that across the country, eight Shaheds and three Kalibr cruise missiles were launched by the Russians.\\nFurther south, a 13-year-old boy was wounded in overnight shelling of Ukraines partially occupied southern Kherson province, said Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, spokesman for the Ukrainian administration of the province.\\nThe child was wounded when the Russian army shelled the village of Mylove on the banks of the Dnieper River in the Beryslav district, Tolokonnikov said.\\nThe child was hospitalized, there is no threat to his life, Tolokonnikov added, he said on state TV.\\nShelling of Kherson province continued Sunday morning, wounding four people in the regional capital, also called Kherson. The regional prosecutors office said that a residential area of the city was targeted by Russian troops operating in the Russia-occupied part of the Kherson province. \\nAt least four citizens were wounded, two of them due to a targeted strike on a high-rise building, the office wrote on Telegram.\\nMeanwhile, Ukraines military reported that the most intense fighting continued in Ukraines industrial east, with attacks focused around Bakhmut, Marinka and Lyman in the countrys Donetsk province, where 46 combat clashes took place.\\nUkrainian forces were advancing amid a massive offensive on the southern and northern flanks of the destroyed city of Bakhmut, Ukraines Eastern Group of Forces spokesman Serhii Cherevaty told Ukrainian state television. But he didnt mention how much progress they made. The details, he said, would be disclosed once Ukrainian forces had analyzed the situation and consolidated their positions.\\nIn its regular update Sunday morning, the General Staff said that over the previous 24 hours, Russia had carried out 27 airstrikes, one missile strike and around 80 attacks from multiple rocket launchers, targeting regions in the north, northeast, east and south of the country.\\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the Black Sea port city of Odesa on Sunday  the day the country honors its navy  to hear a report from the navy commander, discuss prospects for the development of a naval drone and missile program, as well as present awards to service members.\\nIn Russia, local officials reported that air defense systems shot down a drone over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, while the neighboring Kursk region faced shelling attacks. No casualties or damage were reported.\\nFollowing the drama of Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhins rebellion last week, Russian authorities remained defiant. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of Russias lower house of parliament, the State Duma, said Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin came out of this situation having strengthened his position even more both in the country and in the world.\\nRussian society, he said, having passed this test, has shown its maturity. According to Volodin, there was not a single example of someone supporting the rebellion.\\nBut Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the deputy commander of the Russian group of forces fighting in Ukraine, was believed to have been detained days after the mutiny. Its not clear whether Surovikin, who has longtime links to Prigozhin, faces any charges or where he is being held, reflecting the opaque world of the Kremlins politics and uncertainty after the revolt.\\nWriting on Telegram, Volodin said that the Russian president did everything to prevent bloodshed and confusion, including explaining to Wagner fighters the real state of affairs. (Putin) suggested that those who want to defend Russia continue their service with weapons in their hands. As far as I know, many of them agreed to this, Volodin said.\\nIn addition, the speaker of the State Duma said that he had analyzed the challenges Russia faced in the past, affirming that if someone like Putin had been leading the country in 1917 and 1991, there wouldnt have been a revolution in Russia, and the USSR wouldnt have collapsed.\\nBut independent observers and analysts say that Putin may come out politically weakened after first announcing that Wagner would face harsh repercussions, only to later say that the groups forces wouldnt face prosecution. Prigozhin was also allowed to leave Russia for Belarus.\\nPolish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski said Sunday that Poland would send 500 police officers to join 5,000 border guards and 2,000 soldiers already on the countrys border with Belarus. It follows an announcement earlier this week that Poland would strengthen defenses on its eastern border after the relocation of Wagner fighters to Belarus.',\n",

Although thats a relatively small number of Twitters more than 200 million worldwide users, the trouble was widespread enough to cause the #TwitterDown hashtag to trend in some parts of the world.\\nThe service disruptions cropped up a day after Twitter began requiring people to log on to the service in order to view tweets and profiles  a change in its longtime practice to allow all comers to peruse the chatter on what Musk has frequently touted as the worlds digital town square since buying it for $44 billion last year.\\nIn a Friday tweet, Musk described the new restrictions as a temporary measure that was taken because we were getting data pillaged so much that it was degrading service for normal users! Musk elaborated on the measures in a Saturday tweet that announced unverified accounts will temporarily be limited to reading 600 posts per day while verified accounts will be able to scroll through up to 6,000 posts per day.\\nThe restrictions could result in users being locked out of Twitter for the day after scrolling through several hundred tweets.\\nThe higher threshold allowed on verified accounts is part of an $8 per month subscription service that Musk rolled out earlier this year in an effort to boost Twitter revenue that has fallen sharply since he took over the company and laid off roughly three-fourths of the workforce to cuts costs and stave off bankruptcy.\\nAdvertisers have since curbed their spending on Twitter, partly because of changes that have allowed more sometimes hateful and prickly content that offends a wider part of the services audience.

       " '\\nUS President Joe Biden vowed Friday to push ahead with a new plan providing student loan relief for millions of borrowers, while blaming Republican hypocrisy for triggering the days Supreme Court decision that wiped out his original effort.\\nBiden said his administration had already begun the process of working under the authority of the Higher Education Act of 1965, which he called the best path that remains to provide as many borrowers as possible with debt relief.\\nIn the meantime, since student loan-payment requirements are to resume in the fall, the White House is creating an on ramp to repayment and implementing ways to ease borrowers threat of default if they fall behind over the next year.\\nThe president said the new programs will take longer than his initial effort would have to ease student loan debt.\\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House, Biden said borrowers now angry about the courts decision should blame Republicans. He is trying to stay on the political offensive even as the ruling undermined a key promise to young voters who will be vital to his 2024 reelection campaign.\\nThese Republican officials just couldnt bear the thought of providing relief for working class, middle class Americans, Biden said. The hypocrisy of Republican elected officials is stunning.\\nTrying to place staunch opposition to student loan forgiveness on the GOP could allow Bidens reelection campaign to maintain the issue as one of strength in the short term. But that may ultimately offer little solace to 43 million Americans who benefited from the initial program and will now have to wait for its replacement to take shape.\\nWe do not want to go into excruciating debt for our entire lives to enhance our education, Voters of Tomorrow, a Gen Z-led organization that promotes the power of young Americans, said in a statement.\\nThe White House efforts to forgive loans were an attempt to keep a Biden promise stretching back to his 2020 campaign to wipe out student loan debt  an idea that was especially popular with young voters and progressives. Both will be key for the president in next years presidential race but may be less energized about supporting him after the high courts decision.\\nWisdom Cole, the national director of the NAACP Youth  College Division, said Black Americans helped put Biden in the White House, so theres an obligation for him to finish the job with his pledges to provide relief for borrowers.\\nIts going to have a huge impact on the next election, Cole said, adding, If we dont do this, we continue the cycle of seeing our elected leaders make promises and not follow through.\\nA May poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 43% of U.S. adults approve of how Biden sought to handle student debt, similar to his approval rating overall of 40% in the same poll.\\nThe poll suggested that Biden gets credit for his handling of the issue among young adults in particular. Fifty-three percent of adults under age 30 said they approved of Bidens handling of student debt, compared with only 36% who approved of his job performance overall.\\nSenior administration officials said Bidens top advisers had met frequently lately to prepare for a high court ruling on student loans. They also spoke with advocates and allies in Congress. After Fridays decision, Biden met with top advisers and ordered them to immediately begin implementing a new loan plan.\\nThe White House argues that its new efforts will stand up to future legal challenges, even given the Supreme Courts 6-3 current conservative majority. However, the administration also insisted its original plan was legal .\\nBiden bristled at suggestions his efforts to ease student loan burdens got borrowers hopes up unnecessarily.\\nI didnt give any false hope, he said. The Republicans snatched away the hope that they were given.\\nThe political stakes are especially high since progressive Democrats in Congress and activists have been clamoring for the administration to offer an alternative to Bidens original student loan plan for months, fearing that the Supreme Court would ultimately move to block the presidents original efforts.\\nMany progressives argued that the Higher Education Act was the best vehicle all along, though the administration worried that implementation might have been slower had it originally tried employing the act.\\nThe new approach uses a provision allowing Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to compromise, waive or release student loans. The Biden administration used the same basis last year to forgive $6 billion in loans for borrowers who were deceived by their colleges.\\nThe details of the new forgiveness will be negotiated through a federal rulemaking process that the administration launched Friday. The process allows the Education Department to write or change federal regulations with the weight of law.\\nAdvertisement\\nBut theres no guarantee that the plan could survive another legal challenge.\\nThe Higher Education Act has been used to cancel student debt but never at this scale, and lawyers for the Trump administration concluded in 2021 that the education secretary does not have statutory authority to provide blanket or mass cancellation under the act.\\nThe GOP has long countered that repaying student loans is a fairness issue, and many leading Republicans celebrated Fridays ruling. Betsy DeVos, who served as secretary of education under President Donald Trump, called Bidens original plan deeply unfair to the majority of Americans who dont have student loans.\\nRepublicans now seeking their partys 2024 presidential nomination lined up to applaud the decision, with former Vice President Mike Pence saying he was pleased that the court struck down the radical lefts effort to use the money of taxpayers who played by the rules and repaid their debts in order to cancel the debt of bankers and lawyers in New York, San Francisco, and Washington.\\nAddressing the Moms for Liberty conference in Philadelphia on Friday, Trump slammed Bidens efforts on student loans as a way of trying to buy votes, thats all it was. Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the Supreme Court was right to throw out Joe Bidens power grab.\\nAfter Biden announced his response, some Republicans were equally quick to reject it.\\nTaxpayers just got sucker punched  again  by this administration, said Rep. Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina Republican. Today, President Biden announced that taxpayers will be forced to pay for the costliest regulation in our nations history.',\n",

Wade, marked the realization of a long-sought conservative legal goal, this time finding that race-conscious admissions plans violate the Constitution and a law that applies to colleges that receive federal funding, as almost all do.\\nThose schools will be forced to reshape their admissions practices, especially top schools that are more likely to consider the race of applicants.\\nChief Justice John Roberts said that for too long universities have concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individuals identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.\\nFrom the White House, President Joe Biden said he strongly, strongly disagreed with the courts ruling and urged colleges to seek other routes to diversity rather than let the ruling be the last word.\\nBesides the conservative-liberal split, the fight over affirmative action showed the deep gulf between the three justices of color, each of whom wrote separately and vividly about race in America and where the decision might lead.\\nJustice Clarence Thomas  the nations second Black justice, who had long called for an end to affirmative action  wrote that the decision sees the universities admissions policies for what they are: rudderless, race-based preferences designed to ensure a particular racial mix in their entering classes.\\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, the courts first Latina, wrote in dissent that the decision rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress.',\n",

In the Paris region alone, the number of officers deployed was more than doubled to 5,000.\\nThe professionals of disorder must go home, Darmanin said. While theres no need yet to declare a state of emergency  a measure taken to quell weeks of rioting in 2005  he added: The states response will be extremely firm.\\nThere were 100 arrests nationwide Thursday night, according to a national police spokesperson, as officials reported scattered clashes in cities across the country despite the stepped-up deployments.\\nIn the usually tranquil Pyrenees town of Pau in southwestern France, a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a new police office, national police said. Vehicles were set on fire in Toulouse and a tramway train was torched in a suburb of Lyon, police said. Paris police said its officers made 40 arrests Thursday, some on the margins of the largely peaceful memorial march for the teen and others elsewhere.\\nThe interior minister had reported 180 arrests nationwide before Thursday.\\nBus and tram services in the Paris area shut down before sunset as a precaution to safeguard transportation workers and passengers.\\nThe town of Clamart, home to 54,000 people in the French capitals southwest suburbs, said it was taking the extraordinary step of imposing an overnight curfew from Thursday through Monday, citing the risk of new public order disturbances. The mayor of Neuilly-sur-Marne announced a similar curfew in that town in the eastern suburbs.\\nMarseille, the giant port city in the south of France, saw the beginnings of unrest Thursday evening, with several hundred young people roaming the city center and setting fire to trash containers, including in front of the regions main administrative building, police said. Around 1 a.m. local time, regional officials tweeted that police were trying to disperse violent groups in the city center. Police said they had made 28 arrests, though they gave no time frame.\\nThe unrest extended even to Brussels, where about a dozen people were detained during scuffles related to the shooting in France. Police spokeswoman Ilse Van de Keere said that several fires were brought under control and that at least one car was burned.\\nThe shooting captured on video shocked the country and stirred up long-simmering tensions between police and young people in housing projects and other disadvantaged neighborhoods.\\nThe teenagers family and their lawyers havent said the police shooting was race-related and they didnt release his surname or details about him.\\nStill, his death inflamed raw nerves in neighborhoods that have welcomed generations of immigrants from Frances former colonies and elsewhere. Their France-born children frequently complain they are subjected to police ID checks and harassment far more frequently than white people or those in more affluent neighborhoods.\\nAnti-racism activists renewed their complaints about police behavior.\\nWe have to go beyond saying that things need to calm down, said Dominique Sopo, head of the campaign group SOS Racisme. The issue here is how do we make it so that we have a police force that when they see Blacks and Arabs, dont tend to shout at them, use racist terms against them and in some cases, shoot them in the head.',\n",
       " '\\nScientists have observed for the first time the faint ripples caused by the motion of black holes that are gently stretching and squeezing everything in the universe.\\nThey reported Wednesday that they were able to hear what are called low-frequency gravitational waves  changes in the fabric of the universe that are created by huge objects moving around and colliding in space.\\nIts really the first time that we have evidence of just this large-scale motion of everything in the universe, said Maura McLaughlin, co-director of NANOGrav, the research collaboration that published the results in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\\nEinstein predicted that when really heavy objects move through spacetime  the fabric of our universe  they create ripples that spread through that fabric. Scientists sometimes liken these ripples to the background music of the universe.\\nIn 2015, scientists used an experiment called LIGO to detect gravitational waves for the first time and showed Einstein was right. But so far, those methods have only been able to catch waves at high frequencies, explained NANOGrav member Chiara Mingarelli, an astrophysicist at Yale University.\\nThose quick chirps come from specific moments when relatively small black holes and dead stars crash into each other, Mingarelli said.\\nIn the latest research, scientists were searching for waves at much lower frequencies. These slow ripples can take years or even decades to cycle up and down, and probably come from some of the biggest objects in our universe: supermassive black holes billions of times the mass of our sun.\\nGalaxies across the universe are constantly colliding and merging together. As this happens, scientists believe the enormous black holes at the centers of these galaxies also come together and get locked into a dance before they finally collapse into each other, explained Szabolcs Marka, an astrophysicist at Columbia University who was not involved with the research.\\nThe black holes send off gravitational waves as they circle around in these pairings, known as binaries.\\nSupermassive black hole binaries, slowly and calmly orbiting each other, are the tenors and bass of the cosmic opera, Marka said.\\nNo instruments on Earth could capture the ripples from these giants. So we had to build a detector that was roughly the size of the galaxy, said NANOGrav researcher Michael Lam of the SETI Institute.\\nThe results released this week included 15 years of data from NANOGrav, which has been using telescopes across North America to search for the waves. Other teams of gravitational wave hunters around the world also published studies, including in Europe, India, China and Australia.\\nThe scientists pointed telescopes at dead stars called pulsars, which send out flashes of radio waves as they spin around in space like lighthouses.\\nThese bursts are so regular that scientists know exactly when the radio waves are supposed to arrive on our planet  like a perfectly regular clock ticking away far out in space, said NANOGrav member Sarah Vigeland, an astrophysicist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. But as gravitational waves warp the fabric of spacetime, they actually change the distance between Earth and these pulsars, throwing off that steady beat.\\nBy analyzing tiny changes in the ticking rate across different pulsars  with some pulses coming slightly early and others coming late  scientists could tell that gravitational waves were passing through.\\nThe NANOGrav team monitored 68 pulsars across the sky using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico and the Very Large Array in New Mexico. Other teams found similar evidence from dozens of other pulsars, monitored with telescopes across the globe.\\nSo far, this method hasnt been able to trace where exactly these low-frequency waves are coming from, said Marc Kamionkowski, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved with the research.\\nInstead, its revealing the constant hum that is all around us  like when youre standing in the middle of a party, youll hear all of these people talking, but you wont hear anything in particular, Kamionkowski said.\\nThe background noise they found is louder than some scientists expected, Mingarelli said. This could mean that there are more, or bigger, black hole mergers happening out in space than we thought  or point to other sources of gravitational waves that could challenge our understanding of the universe.\\nResearchers hope that continuing to study this kind of gravitational waves can help us learn more about the biggest objects in our universe. It could open new doors to cosmic archaeology that can track the history of black holes and galaxies merging all around us, Marka said.\\nWere starting to open up this new window on the universe, Vigeland said.',\n",
       " '\\nScientists have created embryo models to help study the mysteries of early human development, the medical problems that happen before birth and why many pregnancies fail.\\nThese models are made from stem cells, not egg and sperm, and cant grow into babies.\\nTheyre complete enough to give you a picture of what may be happening in the embryo during pregnancy, but theyre not so complete that you could actually use them for reproduction, said Insoo Hyun, an ethicist and director of life sciences at Bostons Museum of Science. It just will not work.\\nUsing models also avoids the controversy of using real embryos in research, he said.\\nSeveral groups are working on the research. Teams with researchers from the United States and England shared their work in two studies published Tuesday in the journal Nature. Other scientists in Israel and China published studies on their work earlier this month that have not yet been reviewed by peers.\\nWhile previous models mimicked pre-embryos, Hyun said the latest ones model an embryo after it has implanted in the uterus. Real human embryos can be extremely hard to see at that stage because they burrow into the uterus. Each teams models vary in the techniques used and how complete they are, he said, with some mirroring not just the embryo but the very beginnings of the placenta and yolk sac, too.\\nFor these types of models, scientists use a kind of stem cell that is capable of developing into many different types of cells or tissues in the body. They can be from embryos or reprogrammed from adult tissues.\\nThe authors of one Nature paper described models that resemble human embryos nine to 14 days after fertilization.\\nIf we can experimentally model this period, then we can finally start asking questions about how human development happens in those very early stages that are normally hidden within the body of the mother, said author Berna Sozen, who studies developmental stem cell biology at Yale University.\\nScientists will also be able to study embryonic failure, developmental disorders and pregnancy loss, Sozen said. At this point, we dont understand how it goes awry, she said.\\nIn the other Nature paper, Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, an expert in stem cell biology at the California Institute of Technology and the University of Cambridge in England, and colleagues said their model mirrors development up to 14 days from fertilization. That model contains embryonic tissues and tissues that can go on to produce structures surrounding the embryo such as the placenta and yolk sac.\\nJacob Hanna of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, an author of a yet-to-be-reviewed paper, said in an email that his groups model also mirrors human embryo development up to day 14 after fertilization. He said the structures include all embryonic membranes as well as membranes outside the embryo.\\nBoth Hanna and Zernicka-Goetz previously helped create mouse embryo models.\\nDown the road, Zernicka-Goetz said human embryo models could be used to explore the effects of the environment and chemicals on early development. They could even be used to generate tissues used in new medical treatments, she said.\\nSozen also envisions testing drugs on embryo models and exposing them to germs  experiments that cant be done on people who are pregnant.\\nGuidelines from the International Society for Stem Cell Research say scientists cannot put any human embryo model into either a human or non-human uterus. For decades, the society had a related 14-day rule that guided researchers on how long actual embryos can be grown in the lab  which the group recommended relaxing under limited circumstances in 2021. But because the models are not embryos, theyre not subject to the rule.\\nExperts said some in the public have the wrong idea about these models, believing they might be able to create pregnancies. But scientific hurdles prevent this. For example, they dont develop a proper placenta. Even in the future, as the field progresses, there are ways to guard against bad actors who may want to try and create pregnancies from embryo models, said Hyun, who is also a member of Harvard Medical Schools Center for Bioethics.\\nThe ethical reason for not making them complete, he said, is that the whole point of these models is to avoid the embryo controversy.',\n",
       " '\\nYevgeny Prigozhin, owner of the private army of prison recruits and other mercenaries who have fought some of the deadliest battles in Russias invasion of Ukraine, escaped prosecution for his abortive armed rebellion against the Kremlin and arrived Tuesday in Belarus.\\nThe exile of the 62-year-old owner of the Wagner Group was part of a deal that ended the short-lived mutiny in Russia. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko confirmed Prigozhin was in Belarus, and said he and some of his troops were welcome to stay for some time at their own expense.\\nPrigozhin has not been seen since Saturday, when he waved to well-wishers from a vehicle in the southern city of Rostov. He issued a defiant audio statement on Monday. And on Tuesday morning, a private jet believed to belong to him flew from Rostov to an airbase southwest of the Belarusian capital of Minsk, according to data from FlightRadar24.\\nMeanwhile, Moscow said preparations were underway for Wagners troops fighting in Ukraine, who numbered 25,000 according to Prigozhin, to hand over their heavy weapons to Russias military. Prigozhin had said such moves were planned ahead of a July 1 deadline for his fighters to sign contracts  which he opposed  to serve under Russias military command.\\nRussian authorities also said Tuesday they have closed a criminal investigation into the uprising and are pressing no armed rebellion charge against Prigozhin or his followers.\\nStill, Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to set the stage for financial wrongdoing charges against an affiliated organization Prigozhin owns. Putin told a military gathering that Prigozhins Concord Group earned 80 billion rubles ($941 million) from a contract to provide the military with food, and that Wagner had received over 86 billion rubles (over $1 billion) in the past year for wages and additional items.\\nI hope that while doing so they didnt steal anything, or stole not so much, Putin said, adding that authorities would look closely at Concords contract.\\nFor years, Prigozhin has enjoyed lucrative catering contracts with the Russian government. Police who searched his St. Petersburg office on Saturday said they found 4 billion rubles ($48 million) in trucks outside, according to media reports the Wagner boss confirmed. He said the money was intended to pay soldiers families.\\nPrigozhin and his fighters stopped the revolt on Saturday, less than 24 hours after it began and shortly after Putin spoke on national TV, branding the rebellion leaders, whom he did not name, as traitors.\\nThe charge of mounting an armed mutiny could have been punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Prigozhins escape from prosecution, at least on a armed rebellion charge, is in stark contrast to Moscows treatment of its critics, including those staging anti-government protests in Russia, where many opposition figures have been punished with long sentences in notoriously harsh penal colonies.\\nLukashenko said some of the Wagner fighters are now in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine that Russia illegally annexed last September.\\nThe series of stunning events in recent days constitutes the gravest threat so far to Putins grip on power, occurring during the 16-month-old war in Ukraine, and he again acknowledged the threat Tuesday in saying the result could have been a civil war.\\nIn addresses this week, Putin has sought to project stability and demonstrate authority.\\nIn a Kremlin ceremony Tuesday, the president walked down the red-carpeted stairs of the 15th century white-stone Palace of Facets to address soldiers and law enforcement officers, thanking them for their actions to avert the rebellion.\\nIn a further show of business-as-usual, Russian media showed Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, in his military uniform, greeting Cubas visiting defense minister in a pomp-heavy ceremony. Prigozhin has said his goal had been to oust Shoigu and other military brass, not stage a coup against Putin.\\nLukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for 29 years while relying on Russian subsidies and support, portrayed the uprising as the latest development in the clash between Prigozhin and Shoigu. While the mutiny unfolded, he said, he put Belarus armed forces on a combat footing and urged Putin not to be hasty in his response, lest the conflict spiral out of control.\\nHe said he told Prigozhin he would be squashed like a bug if he tried to attack Moscow, and warned that the Kremlin would never agree to his demands.\\nLike Putin, the Belarusian leader portrayed the war in Ukraine as an existential threat, saying, If Russia collapses, we all will perish under the debris.\\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov would not disclose details about the Kremlins deal with Prigozhin, saying only that Putin had provided certain guarantees aimed at avoiding a worst-case scenario.\\nAsked why the rebels were allowed to get as close as about 200 kilometers (about 125 miles) from Moscow without facing serious resistance, National Guard chief Viktor Zolotov told reporters: We concentrated our forces in one fist closer to Moscow. If we spread them thin, they would have come like a knife through butter.\\nZolotov, a former Putin bodyguard, also said the National Guard lacks battle tanks and other heavy weapons and now would get them.\\nThe mercenaries shot down at least six Russian helicopters and a military communications plane as they advanced on Moscow, killing at least a dozen airmen, according to Russian news reports. The Defense Ministry didnt release information about casualties, but Putin honored them Tuesday with a moment of silence.\\nPilots, our combat comrades, died while confronting the mutiny, he said. They didnt waver and fulfilled the orders and their military duty with dignity.\\nSome Russian war bloggers and patriotic activists have vented outrage that Prigozhin and his troops wont be punished for killing the airmen.\\nPrigozhin voiced regret for the deaths in his statement Monday, but said Wagner troops fired because the aircraft were bombing them.\\nIn his televised address Monday night, Putin said rebellion organizers had played into the hands of Ukraines government and its allies. He praised the rank-and-file mutineers, however, who didnt engage in fratricidal bloodshed and stopped on the brink.\\nA Washington-based think tank said that was likely in an effort to retain the Wagner fighters in Ukraine, where Moscow needs trained and effective manpower as it faces a Ukrainian counteroffensive.\\nThe Institute for the Study of War also said the break between Putin and Prigozhin is likely beyond repair, and that providing the Wagner chief and his loyalists with Belarus as an apparent safe haven could be a trap.\\nPutin has offered Prigozhins fighters the choice of either coming under Russian military command, leaving service or going to Belarus.\\nLukashenko said there is no reason to fear Wagners presence in his country, though in Russia, Wagner-recruited convicts have been suspected of violent crimes. The Wagner troops gained priceless military knowledge and experience to share with Belarus, he said.\\nBut exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who challenged Lukashenko in a 2020 election that was widely seen as fraudulent and triggered mass protests, said Wagner troops will threaten the country and its neighbors.\\nBelarusians dont welcome war criminal Prigozhin, she told The Associated Press. If Wagner sets up military bases on our territory, it will pose a new threat to our sovereignty and our neighbors.\\nWhile attention focused on the aftermath of the Russian rebellion, the war in Ukraine continued to take a human toll in what U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink called terrible scenes from another brutal attack.\\nRussian missiles struck Kramatorsk and a village nearby in Ukraines eastern Donetsk region with missiles, killing at least four people, including a child, and wounding some 40 others, with still others under building rubble, including in a caf, authorities reported.',\n",

The recording first aired Monday on CNNs Anderson Cooper 360.\\nThe special counsels indictment alleges that those in attendance at the meeting with Trump  a writer, a publisher and two of Trumps staff members  were shown classified information about a Pentagon plan of attack on an unspecified foreign country.\\nThese are the papers, Trump said in a moment that seems to indicate he was holding a secret Pentagon document with plans to attack Iran. This was done by the military, given to me.\\nTrumps reference to something he says is highly confidential and his apparent showing of documents to other people at the meeting could undercut his later claims in a Fox News Channel interview that he didnt have any documents with him.\\nThere was no document. That was a massive amount of papers, and everything else talking about Iran and other things, Trump said on Fox. And it may have been held up or may not, but that was not a document. I didnt have a document, per se. There was nothing to declassify. These were newspaper stories, magazine stories and articles.\\nTrump pleaded not guilty earlier this month to 37 counts related to the alleged mishandling of classified documents kept at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\\nA Trump campaign spokesman said the audio recording provides context proving, once again, that President Trump did nothing wrong at all.',\n",
       " '\\nYou know instantly when someone is speaking to an infant or small child. It turns out that dolphin mothers also use a kind of high-pitched baby talk.\\nA study published Monday found that female bottlenose dolphins change their tone when addressing their calves. Researchers recorded the signature whistles of 19 mother dolphins in Florida, when accompanied by their young offspring and when swimming alone or with other adults.\\nThe dolphin signature whistle is a unique and important signal  akin to calling out their own name.\\nThey use these whistles to keep track of each other. Theyre periodically saying, Im here, Im here, said study co-author Laela Sayigh, a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution marine biologist in Massachusetts.\\nWhen directing the signal to their calves, the mothers whistle pitch is higher and her pitch range is greater than usual, according to the study published in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\\nThat was true for every one of the moms in the study, all 19 of them, said biologist Peter Tyack, a study co-author from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\\nObtaining this data was no simple feat. Over more than three decades, scientists placed special microphones multiple times on the same wild dolphin mothers in Floridas Sarasota Bay to record their signature whistles. That included years when they had calves and when they didnt  dolphin calves stay with their mothers for an average of three years in Sarasota, and sometimes longer. Fathers dont play a prolonged role in parenting.\\nThis is unprecedented, absolutely fantastic data, said Mauricio Cantor, an Oregon State University marine biologist who was not involved in the study. This study is the result of so much research effort.\\nWhy people, dolphins or other creatures use baby talk isnt certain, but scientists believe it may help offspring learn to pronounce novel sounds. Research dating back to the 1980s suggests that human infants may pay more attention to speech with a greater pitch range. Female rhesus monkeys may alter their calls to attract and hold offsprings attention. And Zebra finches elevate their pitch and slow down their songs to address chicks, perhaps making it easier to learn birdsong.\\nFor the dolphin study, the researchers focused solely on the signature call, so they dont know if dolphins also use baby talk for other exchanges  or whether it helps their offspring learn to talk as it seems to do with humans.\\nIt would make sense if there are similar adaptations in bottlenose dolphins  a long lived, highly acoustic species, where calves must learn to vocalize many sounds to communicate, said Frants Jensen, a behavioral ecologist at Denmarks Aarhus University and a study co-author.\\nAnother possible reason for using specific pitches is to catch the kids attention.\\nIts really important for a calf to know Oh, Mom is talking to me now __ versus just announcing her presence to someone else, added Janet Mann, a marine biologist at Georgetown University, who was not involved in the study.',\n",
       " '\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Monday blasted organizers of a weekend revolt, the gravest threat yet to his power, as traitors who played into the hands of Ukraines government and its allies.\\nSpeaking in a stern tone and looking tired in a five-minute TV address near midnight, Putin sought to project stability. He tried to strike a balance between criticizing the uprisings perpetrators to prevent another crisis, and not antagonizing the bulk of the mercenaries and their hardline supporters, some of whom are incensed at the Kremlins handling of the situation.\\nPutin, whose troops are stretched thin in the face of a Ukrainian counteroffensive, praised the rank and file mercenaries for not letting the situation descend into major bloodshed. And he said the nation had stood united, although there had been localized signs of support for the uprising.\\nEarlier in the day, the head of the mercenary Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led the rebellion, defended his short-lived insurrection. He again taunted Russias military, but said he hadnt been seeking to stage a coup against Putin. On Friday, Prigozhin had called for an armed rebellion to oust the military leadership.\\nPutins address was announced by his spokesman in advance and billed by Russian state media as something that would define the fate of Russia. In fact, the address didnt yield groundbreaking developments.\\nAbbas Gallyamov, a former Kremlin speechwriter turned political analyst, called the address weak. In a Facebook post, he said it was a sign that Putin is acutely dissatisfied with how he looked in this whole story and is trying to correct the situation.\\nThe Kremlin later showed Putin meeting with top security, law enforcement and military officials, including Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, whom the uprising had tried to remove. Putin thanked members of his team for their work over the weekend, implying support for the embattled Shoigu. Earlier, the authorities released a video of Shoigu reviewing troops in Ukraine.\\nPutin, who declined to name Prigozhin, said mutiny organizers had tried to force the groups soldiers to shoot their own.\\nHe said Russias enemies had hoped the mutiny would divide and weaken Russia, but they miscalculated.\\nWestern officials have been muted in their public comments on the mutiny, and President Joe Biden said Monday that the U.S. and NATO were not involved. Speaking at the White House, Biden said he was cautious about speaking publicly because he wanted to give Putin no excuse to blame this on the West and blame this on NATO.\\nWe made clear that we were not involved, we had nothing to do with it, he said.\\nPrigozhin said he had been acting to prevent the destruction of Wagner, his private military company. We started our march because of an injustice, he said in an 11-minute statement Monday, giving no details about where he was or what his plans were.\\nThe injustice apparently was a government order requiring Wagner soldiers, if they want to remain fighting, to sign contracts with the Defense Ministry by July 1, which might effectively disband the group despite its battlefield successes in Ukraine. Prigozhin also accused Russias military of attacking his troops, prompting his march.\\nThe feud between the Wagner Group leader and military brass has festered throughout the war, erupting into mutiny when mercenaries left Ukraine to seize a military headquarters in the southern Russia city of Rostov. They rolled seemingly unopposed for hundreds of miles toward Moscow before turning around after less than 24 hours on Saturday.\\nThe Kremlin said it had made a deal for Prigozhin to move to Belarus and receive amnesty, along with his soldiers. There was no confirmation of his whereabouts Monday.\\nPrigozhin boasted that his march was a master class on how Russias military should have carried out the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. He also mocked the military for security breaches that allowed Wagner to march 780 kilometers (500 miles) toward Moscow without facing resistance.\\nIt remained unclear what would ultimately happen to Prigozhin and his forces under the deal purportedly brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.\\nPrigozhin said Lukashenko proposed finding a way to let Wagner continue its work in a lawful jurisdiction. That suggested Prigozhin might keep his military force, although it wasnt clear which jurisdiction he was referring to.\\nThough the mutiny was brief, it was not bloodless. Russian media reported that several military helicopters and a communications plane were shot down by Wagner forces, killing at least 15. Prigozhin expressed regret for attacking the aircraft but said they were bombing his convoys.\\nRussian media reported that a criminal case against Prigozhin hasnt been closed, despite earlier Kremlin statements, and some Russian lawmakers called for his head. In his address Monday, Putin didnt repeat threats he had made Saturday to punish the mutinys leaders.\\nAndrei Gurulev, a retired general and current lawmaker who has clashed with the mercenary leader, said Prigozhin and his right-hand man, Dmitry Utkin, deserve a bullet in the head.\\nAnd Nikita Yurefev, a city council member in St. Petersburg, said he filed a request with Russias Prosecutor Generals Office and the Federal Security Service, or FSB, asking who would be punished for the rebellion.\\nRussian media reported that Wagner offices in several Russian cities had reopened on Monday and the company had resumed enlisting recruits.\\nIn a return to at least superficial normality, Moscows mayor announced an end to the counterterrorism regime imposed on the capital Saturday, when troops and armored vehicles set up checkpoints on the outskirts and authorities tore up roads leading into the city.\\nFor months, Prigozhin had blasted Shoigu and General Staff chief Gen. Valery Gerasimov with expletive-ridden insults, accusing them of failing to provide his troops with enough ammunition during the fight for the Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, the wars longest and bloodiest battle.\\nPrigozhin said most of his fighters refused to come under the Defense Ministrys command. He said Wagner had planned to hand over the military equipment it was using in Ukraine on June 30 after pulling out of Ukraine and gathering in Rostov, but they were attacked.\\nRussian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said on Twitter that Prigozhins mutiny wasnt a bid for power or an attempt to overtake the Kremlin, but a desperate move amid his escalating rift with the military leadership.\\nWhile Prigozhin could get out of the crisis alive, he doesnt have a political future in Russia under Putin, Stanovaya said.\\nIt was unclear what the fissures opened by the 24-hour rebellion would mean for the war in Ukraine, where Western officials say Russias troops suffer low morale. Wagners forces were key to Russias only land victory in months, in Bakhmut.\\nThe U.K. Ministry of Defense said Monday that Ukraine had gained impetus in its push around Bakhmut, making progress north and south of the town. Ukrainian forces claimed to have retaken Rivnopil, a village in southeast Ukraine that has seen heavy fighting.\\nUkraines President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday after visiting troops in the war-torn Donetsk region that his military had advanced there as well as in Zaporizhzhia.

In a televised speech to the nation, Putin called the rebellion a betrayal and treason.\\nIn allowing Prigozhin and his forces to go free, Peskov said Putins highest goal was to avoid bloodshed and internal confrontation with unpredictable results.\\nMoscow had braced for the arrival of the Wagner forces by erecting checkpoints with armored vehicles and troops on the citys southern edge. Red Square was shut down, and the mayor urged motorists to stay off some roads.\\nBut after the deal was struck, Prigozhin announced that while his men were just 200 kilometers (120 miles) from Moscow, he had decided to retreat to avoid shedding Russian blood. His troops were ordered back to their field camps in Ukraine, where they have been fighting alongside Russian regular soldiers.\\nPrigozhin has demanded the ouster of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, long the target of his withering criticism for his conduct of the war in Ukraine. On Friday, he accused forces under Shoigus command of attacking Wagner camps and killing a huge number of our comrades.\\nPrigozhin did not say whether the Kremlin had responded to his demand. Peskov said the issue could not have been discussed during the negotiations, which were conducted by the president of Belarus, and is the exclusive prerogative of the commander in chief.\\nIf Putin were to agree to Shoigus ouster, it could be politically damaging for the president after he branded Prigozhin a backstabbing traitor.\\nEarly Saturday, Prigozhins private army appeared to control the military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don, a city 660 miles (over 1,000 kilometers) south of Moscow, which runs Russian operations in Ukraine, Britains Ministry of Defense said.\\nA nighttime video from the city posted on Russian messaging app channels showed people cheering Wagner troops as they left Rostov-on-Don. Prigozhin was seen riding in one of the vehicles, and people greeted him and some ran to shake his hand as he lowered the window.

       " '\\nOver 2 million Muslims will take part in this weeks Hajj pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, as one of the worlds largest religious gatherings returns to full capacity following years of coronavirus restrictions.\\nThe Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and all Muslims are required to undertake it at least once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. For the pilgrims, it is a profound spiritual experience that wipes away sins, brings them closer to God and highlights Muslim unity.\\nFor the Saudi royal family, which captured Mecca in the 1920s, organizing the pilgrimage is a major source of pride and legitimacy. Authorities have invested billions of dollars in modern infrastructure, but the Hajj has occasionally been marred by tragedy, as in 2015, when over 2,400 pilgrims died in a stampede.\\nHeres a look at the pilgrimage, which begins on Monday, and its meaning.\\nWHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE HAJJ PILGRIMAGE IN ISLAM?\\nThe pilgrimage draws Muslims from around the world to Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, where they walk in the footsteps of the Prophet Muhammad and retrace the journey of Ibrahim and Ismail, or Abraham and Ishmael as they are known in the Christian and Jewish traditions.\\nAs related in the Quran, Ibrahim is called upon to sacrifice his son Ismail as a test of faith, but God stays his hand at the last moment. Ibrahim and Ismail later are said to have built the Kaaba together. In the Christian and Jewish traditions, Abraham nearly sacrifices his other son, Isaac, on Mount Moriah, which is associated with a major holy site in Jerusalem.\\nThe Kaaba was a center for polytheistic worship among pagan Arabs until the arrival of Islam in the 7th century, when the Prophet Muhammad consecrated the site and inaugurated the Hajj.\\nMuslims do not worship the Kaaba, a cube-shaped structure covered in a black, gold-embroidered cloth, but view it as their most sacred place and a powerful symbol of unity and monotheism. No matter where they are in the world, Muslims face toward the Kaaba during their daily prayers.\\nThe Hajj has been held every year since the time of the prophet, even through wars, plagues and other turmoil.\\nIn the Middle Ages, Muslim rulers organized massive caravans with armed escorts that would depart from Cairo, Damascus and other cities. It was an arduous journey through deserts where Bedouin tribes carried out raids and demanded tribute. A notorious Bedouin raid in 1757 wiped out an entire Hajj caravan, killing thousands of pilgrims.\\nIn 2020, amid worldwide coronavirus lockdowns, Saudi Arabia limited the pilgrimage to a few thousand citizens and local residents. This is the first year it returns to full capacity.\\nHOW DO MUSLIMS PREPARE FOR THE HAJJ?\\nSome pilgrims spend their whole lives saving up for the journey or wait years before getting a permit, which Saudi authorities distribute to countries based on a quota system. Travel agents offer packages catering to all income levels, and charities assist needy pilgrims.\\nPilgrims begin by entering a state of spiritual purity known as ihram. Women forgo make-up and perfume and cover their hair, while men change into seamless terrycloth robes. The garments cannot contain any stitching, a rule intended to promote unity among rich and poor.\\nPilgrims are forbidden from cutting their hair, trimming their nails or engaging in sexual intercourse while in the state of ihram. They are not supposed to argue or fight, but the heat, crowds and difficulty of the journey inevitably test peoples patience.\\nMany Muslims visit Medina, where the Prophet Muhammad is buried and where he built the first mosque, before heading to Mecca.\\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING THE HAJJ?\\nThe Hajj begins with Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca counter-clockwise seven times while reciting prayers. Then they walk between two hills in a reenactment of Hagars search for water for her son, Ismail, a story that occurs in different forms in Muslim, Christian and Jewish traditions.\\nAll of this takes place inside Meccas Grand Mosque  the worlds largest  which encompasses the Kaaba and the two hills.\\nThe next day, pilgrims head to Mount Arafat, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of Mecca, where the Prophet Muhammad delivered his final sermon. Here, they stand in prayer throughout the day asking God for forgiveness of their sins in what many view as the spiritual high point of the pilgrimage.\\nAround sunset, pilgrims walk or take buses to an area called Muzdalifa, 9 kilometers (5.5 miles) west of Arafat. They pick up pebbles to use the next day in a symbolic stoning of the devil in the valley of Mina, where Muslims believe Ibrahim was tempted to ignore Gods command to sacrifice his son. The pilgrims stay for several nights in Mina in one of the largest tent camps in the world.\\nThe pilgrimage ends with a final circling of the Kaaba and further casting of stones at Mina. Men often shave their heads and women clip a lock of hair, signaling renewal. Many will assume the title of hajj or hajja  a great honor, particularly in more traditional communities. Some paint murals on their homes with images of airplanes, ships and the Kaaba to commemorate the journey.\\nThe final days of Hajj coincide with Eid al-Adha, or the festival of sacrifice, a joyous occasion celebrated by Muslims around the world to commemorate Ibrahims test of faith. During the three-day Eid, Muslims slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to the poor.',\n",
       " '\\nFor the first time in his more than 20-year rule, President Vladimir Putins power appeared to hang in the balance this weekend.\\nAnd even though the rebellious Russian mercenary forces who descended on Moscow have turned back, Putin will struggle to project the image of a man in total control that he once did. That could set the stage for further challenges to his rule at home and could weaken Russias hand in the war in Ukraine.\\nWith spectacular ease and a stated aim of ousting Russias defense minister, Yevgeny Prigozhins Wagner troops swept into Rostov-on-Don, a city of 1.1 million people, and seized the military headquarters there. They then continued hundreds of kilometers (miles) north on a lightning march toward the capital without meeting any serious resistance.\\nSome were even cheered  a sign that Prigozhins positioning of himself as an enemy of a corrupt and incompetent elite resonated and a detail that will not be lost on those surrounding Putin in the coming days.\\nThis whole episode has sowed really profound anxiety across Russias elites, said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the Institute for Strategic Studies. The actions of the Russian leaders one-time protg severely shake confidence in Putin among those around him who matter.\\nFor several tense hours, the Kremlin seemed powerless as Wagner convoys rolled through Russia, smashing occasional roadblocks and shooting down aircraft sent by the military in a desperate attempt to stop them.\\nWith the bulk of Russian forces tied up in the fighting in Ukraine, authorities rushed a motley collection of troops and police to protect Moscow, dug up roads and even blew up bridges to slow down the onslaught.\\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and General Staff chief Gen. Valery Gerasimov vanished from public view on that decisive day, amplifying the sense of weakness and lack of control.\\nIn a televised address to the nation broadcast early Saturday, a somber-looking Putin accused Prigozhin of betrayal and compared the situation to the collapse of the Russian empire in 1917.\\nBut hours later, the Russian leader granted Prigozhin amnesty  on condition that he goes into exile in Belarus.\\nWhile the Kremlin tried to cast the deal as a wise move that helped avoid a looming bloodbath, it was a remarkable compromise for a man who has relentlessly suppressed any sign of dissent and sometimes violently silenced foes daring to criticize him.\\nThe quick pardon for Prigozhin stood in contrast to the Kremlins methodical crackdown on dissidents and critics of the war in Ukraine, who have faced prosecution, forced exile or even violent deaths. For many in Putins Russia, his handling of the revolt was a sign of unforgivable weakness.\\nPrigozhin demonstrated that its possible to capture a city of a million people with impunity, put demands to the countrys leadership, refuse to obey its orders and mount military marches on Moscow while killing Russian soldiers on the way, said Viktor Alksnis, a retired Soviet air force colonel and current hardliner who expresses views shared by many Russian hawks, who have been increasingly critical of Putins rule and his handling of the war in Ukraine. Russia has moved a step closer to its final and irreparable collapse.\\nThe blow to Putin comes on top of repeated Russian failures in his 16-month war in Ukraine.\\nGould-Davies noted that the mutiny has destabilized the military and badly hurt troop morale, opening new opportunities to Ukraine, now in the initial stages of its counteroffensive.\\nThis is Russians killing Russians on Russian territory while Russia is trying to contain a Ukrainian counteroffensive, Gould-Davies observed. This is not what Russia wants in wartime.\\nWhile the deal with Prigozhin could bring some Wagner troops under the control of the Defense Ministry  a demand that the mercenary leader had previously rejected, precipitating the conflict  its a small compensation for the huge damage to the government authority that the crisis has inflicted.\\nKirill Rogov, a political analyst who has long studied Putins politics, observed that the problem was of the Russian presidents own making: He tolerated Prigozhins feud with the top military leaders as part of his strategy to shift blame for the military blunders in Ukraine and play members of the elite against one another in an apparent belief that he could fully control Prigozhin.\\nGolems creator always thinks that he can be stopped and he makes him look increasingly convincing in order to scare others, Rogov wrote in a commentary, referring to a clay creature brought to life in Jewish folklore.\\nPutin did stop Prigozhin in the end  but at a steep price.',\n",
       " '\\nPilgrims streamed into Meccas Grand Mosque on Saturday to perform their final rituals before heading to Mina in preparation for the Hajj, the fifth pillar of Islam and one of the largest religious gatherings in the world.\\nThey moved through the white marble courtyards of Islams holiest site to perform the tawaf, the walking circuit around the Kaaba, the cube-shaped structure covered in a black, gold-embroidered cloth, their fervent recitations ringing through the air.\\nPeople on the ground floor closest to the Kaaba shuffled due to the sheer number of participants. Those on the upper floors were able to walk more briskly, even run. Pilgrims raised their hands in supplication, took selfies or video, and phoned their relatives as they performed the tawaf.\\nThey then walked or ran between two hills in a re-enactment of Hagars search for water for her son, Ismail, a story that occurs in different forms in Muslim, Christian and Jewish traditions.\\nPilgrims must enter a state of spiritual purity, known as ihram, for the Hajj.\\nMen wear seamless white robes, a rule intended to promote unity among rich and poor. Women cover their body and hair.\\nIn between rituals and the five daily prayers, which bring the area to a solemn standstill, pilgrims sought out shade, snacked and flocked to the many shops and air-conditioned malls encircling the Grand Mosque to relax before the arduous days ahead.\\nSaudi Arabia has restored full pilgrim capacity for this years Hajj, following three years of dramatically reduced numbers due to the pandemic, with more than 2 million Muslims expected to take part.\\nI think this year (the) crowd is too much said Mahboub Morshed, a 42-year-old software engineer from Bangladesh, referring to the thinner attendance of previous years. But the government and this management (Ministry of Hajj and Umrah) is trying to manage this very smoothly.',\n",

Crews are still looking for evidence of what occurred near the Titanic shipwreck, 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) below the surface.\\nExperts had cautioned that under intense pressure at extreme depths the Titans hull could implode, which would result in instant death for anyone aboard the vessel.\\nI dont think people can appreciate the amazing energy involved in the destructive process of an implosion, Bob Ballard, a member of the team that found the Titanic wreck in 1985, told ABC News. It just takes out and literally shreds everything.\\nWhile OceanGate Expeditions, which owned and operated the craft, touted the Titans roomier cylinder-shaped cabin made of a carbon-fiber, industry experts say it was a departure from the sphere-shaped cabins made of titanium used by most submersibles.\\nA sphere is a perfect shape because water pressure is exerted equally on all areas, said Chris Roman, a professor at the University of Rhode Islands Graduate School of Oceanography.\\nThe 22-foot long (6.7-meter long), 23,000-pound (10,432-kilogram) Titans larger internal volume  while still cramped with a maximum of five seated people  meant it was subjected to more external pressure.\\nThe water pressure at 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) below the surface at the site of the Titanic wreck is roughly 400 atmospheres or 6,000 pounds per square inch.\\nArun Bansil, a Northeastern University physics professor, likened that humongous pressure to the force of a whale biting on somebody.\\nThough the Titan had a composite hull with inbuilt sensors that could withstand high pressures near the sea floor, any defect could result in a near instantaneous implosion in less than 40 milliseconds, said associate professor Eric Fusil, director of the Shipbuilding Hub at the University of Adelaide in Australia.\\nThe passengers probably would have had no idea what happened, Bansil said.\\nThe Titan had made more than two dozen deep-sea dives, which put repeated stress on the hull, said Jasper Graham-Jones, an associate professor of mechanical and marine engineering at the University of Plymouth in the United Kingdom.\\nThat stress could potentially cause delamination, a horizontal splitting of the carbon-fiber hull, he said.\\nNeither the Coast Guard nor OceanGate Expeditions have provided details on the implosion.\\nA similar disaster occurred in 1963 when the USS Thresher, a nuclear-powered submarine, likely imploded when it exceeded test depth after a series of other failures. Killed were 129 sailors and civilians on a routine test dive off Cape Cod.',\n",

Prigozhin also said his forces shot down a Russian military helicopter that fired on a civilian convoy, but there was no independent confirmation.\\nAnd despite Prigozhins statements that Wagner convoys had entered Rostov-on-Don, there was no confirmation of that yet on Russian social networks. Videos showed heavy trucks blocking highways leading to the city, long convoys of National Guard trucks were seen on a road outside Rostov-on-Don and armored vehicles were roaming the streets.\\nPrigozhin said Wagner field camps in Ukraine were struck by rockets, helicopter gunships and artillery fire on orders from Gerasimov following a meeting with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, at which they decided to destroy Wagner.\\nThe Wagner forces have played a crucial role in Russias war in Ukraine, succeeding in taking the city where the bloodiest and longest battles have taken place, Bakhmut. But Prigozhin has increasingly criticized Russias military brass, accusing it of incompetence and of starving his troops of weapons and ammunition.\\nPrigozhin, who said he had 25,000 troops under his command, said late Friday his troops would punish Shoigu in an armed rebellion and urged the army not to offer resistance. This is not a military coup, but a march of justice, Prigozhin declared.\\nThe National Anti-Terrorism Committee, which is part of the Federal Security Services, or FSB, has charged him with calling for an armed rebellion, which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.\\nThe FSB urged Wagners contract soldiers to arrest Prigozhin and refuse to follow his criminal and treacherous orders. It called his statements a stab in the back to Russian troops and said they amounted to fomenting an armed conflict in Russia.\\nPresident Vladimir Putin has been informed about the situation and all the necessary measures were being taken, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\\nHeavy military trucks and armored vehicles were seen in several parts of central Moscow early Saturday, and soldiers toting assault rifles were deployed outside the main building of the Defense Ministry. The area around the presidential administration near Red Square was blocked, snarling traffic.\\nBut even amid the heightened military presence, downtown bars and restaurants were filled with customers. At one club near the headquarters of the FSB, people were dancing in the street near the entrance.\\nPrigozhin, whose feud with the Defense Ministry dates back years, had refused to comply with a requirement that military contractors sign contracts with the ministry before July 1. In a statement late Friday, he said he was ready to find a compromise but they have treacherously cheated us.\\nToday they carried out a rocket strike on our rear camps, and a huge number of our comrades got killed, he said. The Defense Ministry denied attacking the Wagner camps.\\nPrigozhin claimed that Shoigu went to the Russian military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don personally to direct the strike and then cowardly fled.\\nThis scum will be stopped, he said of Shoigu.\\nThe evil embodied by the countrys military leadership must be stopped, he shouted, urging the army not to offer any resistance to Wagner as it moves to restore justice.\\nCol. Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the deputy commander of the Russian group of forces fighting in Ukraine, urged the Wagner forces to stop any move against the army, saying it would play into the hands of Russias enemies, who are waiting to see the exacerbation of our domestic political situation.\\nTatiana Stanovaya, a political analyst, predicted this would be the end of Prigozhin.\\nNow that the state has actively engaged, theres no turning back, she tweeted. The termination of Prigozhin and Wagner is imminent. The only possibility now is absolute obliteration, with the degree of resistance from the Wagner group being the only variable. Surovikin was dispatched to convince them to surrender. Confrontation seems totally futile.\\nLt. Gen. Vladimir Alexeyev, a top military officer, denounced Prigozhins move as madness that threatened to unleash a civil war.\\nIts a stab in the back to the country and the president, he said. Its impossible to imagine a stronger blow to the image of Russia and its armed forces. Such a provocation could only be staged by enemies of Russia.\\nThe Defense Ministry said in a statement that Ukraines military was concentrating troops to launch an attack around Bakhmut to take advantage of Prigozhins provocation. It said Russian artillery and warplanes were firing on Ukrainian forces as they prepared to start an offensive in the area.\\nIn Washington, a spokesman for the National Security Council, Adam Hodge, said: We are monitoring the situation and will be consulting with allies and partners on these developments.\\nIn other developments in the Ukraine war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on other countries to heed warnings that Russia may be planning to attack an occupied nuclear power plant to cause a radiation disaster.\\nMembers of his government briefed international representatives on the possible threat to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, whose six reactors have been shut down for months. Zelenskyy said he expected other nations to give appropriate signals and exert pressure on Moscow.\\nThe Kremlins spokesman has denied the threat to the plant is coming from Russian forces.\\nThe potential for a life-threatening release of radiation has been a concern since Russian troops invaded Ukraine last year and seized the plant, Europes largest nuclear power station. The head of the U.N.s atomic energy agency spent months trying to negotiate the establishment of a safety perimeter to protect the facility as nearby areas came under repeated shelling, but he has been unsuccessful.\\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency noted Thursday that the military situation has become increasingly tense while a Ukrainian counteroffensive that got underway this month unfolds in Zaporizhzhia province, where the namesake plant is located, and in an adjacent part of Donetsk province.\\nAlthough the last of the plants six reactors was shut down last fall to reduce the risk of a meltdown, experts have warned that a radiation release could still happen if the system that keeps the reactors cores and spent nuclear fuel cool loses power or water.\\nDuring months of fighting, Russia and Ukraine have traded blame over which side was increasing the threat to the plant.\\nUkrainian officials have accused Russia of mining the plants cooling system, already under threat from a dam collapse that drew down water in a reservoir used by the power station.',\n",
       " '\\nUS President Joe Biden on Thursday pronounced the U.S.-India relationship never stronger and rolled out new business deals with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as human rights activists and American lawmakers questioned the administrations decision to honor the leader with a pomp-filled state visit.\\nIn a joint news conference with Modi, Biden called the relationship between the U.S. and India among the most consequential in the world and more dynamic than at any time in history. He underscored how two of the worlds most powerful democracies were cooperating on issues such as the climate, health care and space, saying that the U.S-India economic relationship was booming.\\nBut Modi bristled at a reporters question about his countrys commitment to democratic values as the country has seen an erosion of religious, political and press freedoms under his watch.\\nDemocracy is our spirit, Modi, who rarely takes questions from journalists, said through an interpreter. Democracy runs in our veins. We live democracy and our ancestors have actually put words to this concept. He said India has proved that democracies can deliver and when I say deliver, this is regardless of class, creed, religion, gender.\\nYet Modi has faced criticism over legislation amending the countrys citizenship law that fast-tracks naturalization for some migrants but excludes Muslims, a rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities by Hindu nationalists, and the recent conviction of Indias top opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, for mocking Modis surname.\\nNevertheless, later in a 59-minute address before a joint meeting of Congress, Modi insisted that in India diversity is a natural way of life.\\nWe are home to all faiths in the world, and we celebrate all of them, added Modi, in a line that brought many cheering lawmakers to their feet.\\nThe premiers description runs counter to accusations by rights groups of widespread attacks and discrimination against Indias Muslims and other minorities under Modi.\\nA group of more than 70 lawmakers wrote to Biden this week urging him to raise concerns about the erosion of religious, press and political freedoms during the visit. At least six Democratic lawmakers Democratic Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Greg Casar of Texas, Jamaal Bowman and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York  boycotted Modis address to Congress, because of concerns about his human rights records.\\nWhen it comes to standing up for human rights, actions speak louder than words, Bush, Tlaib, Omar and Bowman said in a joint statement. By bestowing Prime Minister Modi with the rare honor of a joint address, Congress undermines its ability to be a credible advocate for the rights of religious minorities and journalists around the world.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nStanding alongside Modi, Biden emphasized that press, religious and other fundamental freedoms should be at the core of how both democracies operate. During their Oval Office meeting, Biden said, he and Modi had a good discussion about democratic values while Modi said theres absolutely no space for discrimination when pressed about his own commitment on human rights.\\nThe state visit, just the third of the Bidens presidency, was certainly a glitzy affair.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nThousands gathered on the White House South Lawn for the welcoming ceremony, listening to performances by violinist Vibha Janakiraman and the a cappella group Penn Masala. As Modi arrived, the crowd  including many members of the Indian diaspora  broke out in a chant of Modi, Modi, Modi.\\nAll eyes are on the two largest democracies in the world, India and America, Modi said. I believe that our strategic partnership is important. Im confident that working together will be successful.\\nLater, Modi told Congress that our partnership augurs well for the future of democracy as the two countries expand partnerships in defense, semiconductor manufacturing and other industries. He also cheered the samosa caucusthe five U.S. House members of Indian descentand Vice President Kamala Harris, who is Black and of Indian descent, as examples of the impact of the diaspora.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nBiden administration officials say honoring Modi, the leader of the conservative Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is Diplomacy 101. The U.S.-India relationship will be vital in coming decades as both sides navigate an ascendant China and the enormity of climate change, artificial intelligence, supply chain resilience and other issues.\\nOn the issues that matter most that will define the future, our nations look to one another including on critical regional and global issues, Biden said.\\nAmong the announcements made Thursday is an agreement that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.\\nThe Biden administration also announced plans to bolster Indias semiconductor industry. U.S.-based Micron Technology has agreed to build a $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, with Micron spending more than $800 million and India financing the rest. U.S.-based Applied Materials will launch a new semiconductor center for commercialization and innovation in India, and Lam Research, another semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, will start a training program for 60,000 Indian engineers.\\nOn the space front, India signed on to the Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space exploration cooperation among nations participating in NASAs lunar exploration plans. NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to make a joint mission to the International Space Station next year.\\nWe made critical and emerging technologies the pillar of our next generation partnership to ensure these technologies promote and protect our values, remain open, accessible, trusted and secure, Biden added. All this matters for America, for India and for the world.\\nAt the welcoming ceremony, Modi called the Indian diaspora in America  the millions of immigrants and their children from the subcontinent living in the U.S.  the real strength of the U.S.-India relationship. He said the honor of a formal state visit  the first in the U.S. for India since Barack Obama honored Modis predecessor, Manmohan Singh, in 2009  reflected the positive impact Indians are having worldwide.\\nModi, the son of a tea seller who rose to be Indias premier, also recalled that the first time he visited the White House was three decades ago as a common man.\\nI have come here many times but today for the first time, the doors of the White House have been opened for the Indian American community in such large numbers, Modi said to an estimated crowd of 7,000.\\nDespite the major deals, the visit was shadowed by concerns laid out by rights activists and lawmakers who question Modis commitment to democratic principles.\\nIn 2005, the U.S. revoked Modis visa to the U.S., citing concerns that, as chief minister of the state of Gujarat, he did not act to stop communal violence during 2002 anti-Muslim riots that left more than 1,000 people dead. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.\\nBiden and Modi have also had differences over Russias war in Ukraine. India abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and refused to join the global coalition against Russia. Since the start of the war, the Modi government has also dramatically increased its purchase of Russian oil.\\nWhite House officials note that there are signs of change in Indias relationship with Russia, which has long been New Delhis biggest defense supplier.\\nIndia is moving away from Russian military equipment, looking more to the U.S., Israel, Britain and other nations. Modi recently met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and has spoken out about his worries about the potential use of nuclear weapons by Russia.\\nModi, before Congress, said the war is causing great pain in Ukraine and having residual effects on Europe and beyond.\\nThis is not an era of war, but it is one of dialogue and diplomacy Modi said. And we must all do what we can to stop the bloodshed and human suffering.\\nWithout specifically naming China, Modi also addressed heightened tensions in the region, saying dark clouds of coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the Indo Pacific.\\nLater Thursday, Modi attended a lavish White House state dinner in his honor.',\n",
       " '\\nA submersible carrying five people to the Titanic imploded near the site of the shipwreck and killed everyone on board, authorities said Thursday, bringing a tragic end to a saga that included an urgent around-the-clock search and a worldwide vigil for the missing vessel.\\nThe sliver of hope that remained for finding the five men alive was wiped away early Thursday, when the submersibles 96-hour supply of oxygen was expected to run out following its Sunday launch and the Coast Guard announced that debris had been found roughly 1,600 feet (488 meters) from the Titanic in North Atlantic waters.\\nThis was a catastrophic implosion of the vessel, said Rear Adm. John Mauger, of the First Coast Guard District.\\nAfter the craft was reported missing, the U.S. Navy went back and analyzed its acoustic data and found an anomaly that was consistent with an implosion or explosion in the general vicinity of where the Titan submersible was operating when communications were lost, a senior Navy official told The Associated Press on Thursday.\\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive acoustic detection system.\\nThe Navy passed on that information to the Coast Guard, which continued its search because the Navy did not consider the data to be definitive.\\nOceanGate Expeditions, the company that owned and operated the submersible, said in a statement that all five people in the vessel, including CEO and pilot Stockton Rush, have sadly been lost.\\nThe others on board were two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.\\nThese men were true explorers who shared a distinct spirit of adventure, and a deep passion for exploring and protecting the worlds oceans, OceanGate said in a statement. We grieve the loss of life and joy they brought to everyone they knew.\\nOceanGate has been chronicling the Titanics decay and the underwater ecosystem around it via yearly voyages since 2021. The company has not responded to additional questions about the Titans voyage this week.\\nThe companys office was closed indefinitely while the staff copes with the tragic loss of their team member, according to a statement Thursday by the Port of Everett, which is about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of downtown Seattle and is home to OceanGate.\\nThe Coast Guard will continue searching for more signs about what happened to the Titan.\\nWhile the Navy likely detected the implosion Sunday through its acoustics system, underwater sounds heard Tuesday and Wednesday  which initially gave hope for a possible rescue  were probably unrelated to the submersible. The Navys possible clue was not known publicly until Thursday, when The Wall Street Journal first reported it.\\nWith a search area covering thousands of miles  twice the size of Connecticut and in waters 2 1/2 miles (4 kilometers) deep  rescuers all week rushed ships, planes and other equipment to the site of the disappearance.\\nBroadcasters around the world started newscasts at the critical hour Thursday with news of the submersible. The Saudi-owned satellite channel Al Arabiya showed a clock on air counting down to their estimate of when the air could potentially run out.\\nThe White House thanked the U.S. Coast Guard, along with Canadian, British and French partners who helped in the search and rescue efforts.\\nOur hearts go out to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives on the Titan. They have been through a harrowing ordeal over the past few days, and we are keeping them in our thoughts and prayers, it said in a statement.\\nThe Titan launched at 6 a.m. Sunday and was reported overdue that afternoon about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. Johns, Newfoundland. By Thursday, when the oxygen supply was expected to run out, there was little hope of finding the crew alive.\\nIn 2021 and 2022, at least 46 people successfully traveled on OceanGates submersible to the Titanic site, according to letters the company filed with a U.S. District Court in Norfolk, Virginia, that oversees matters involving the shipwreck. But questions about the submersibles safety were raised by former passengers.\\nOne of the companys first customers likened a dive he made to the site two years ago to a suicide mission.\\nImagine a metal tube a few meters long with a sheet of metal for a floor. You cant stand. You cant kneel. Everyone is sitting close to or on top of each other, said Arthur Loibl, a retired businessman and adventurer from Germany. You cant be claustrophobic.\\nU.S. Coast Guard Capt.

The U.S. Coast Guard says sounds and banging noises have been heard from the search area for Titanic submersible. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)\\nDuring the 2 1/2-hour descent and ascent, the lights were turned off to conserve energy, he said, with the only illumination coming from a fluorescent glow stick.\\nThe dive was repeatedly delayed to fix a problem with the battery and the balancing weights. In total, the voyage took 10 1/2 hours.\\nNicolai Roterman, a deep-sea ecologist and lecturer in marine biology at the University of Portsmouth, England, said the disappearance of the Titan highlights the dangers and unknowns of deep-sea tourism.\\nEven the most reliable technology can fail, and therefore accidents will happen, Roterman said. With the growth in deep-sea tourism, we must expect more incidents like this.',\n",
       " '\\nCooking gas caused a massive explosion at a barbecue restaurant in northwestern China, killing 31 people and injuring seven others during national celebrations on the eve of a long holiday weekend, authorities said Thursday.\\nThe blast tore through the restaurant at around 8:40 p.m. Wednesday on a busy street in Yinchuan, the capital of the traditionally Muslim Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, as people gathered ahead of the Dragon Boat Festival, the official Xinhua News Agency said.\\nThe explosion left many people unconscious and they needed to be carried out of the shop, according to the online news site The Paper, which quoted a member of the search and rescue team. Victims included elderly people and high school students, it added.\\nAn hour before the explosion, employees noticed the smell of cooking gas and discovered that a gas tank valve was broken, according to Xinhua. The blast occurred while an employee was replacing the valve.\\nChinese President Xi Jinping demanded urgent medical care for the injured and a safety overhaul after the explosion, Xinhua said. He urged efforts to quickly determine the cause of the accident and hold people accountable under the law.\\nXi also said all regions and related departments should address all types of risks and hidden dangers and launch campaigns to promote workplace safety.\\nNine people have been detained by authorities, including the owner of the restaurant, shareholders and employees. Their assets have also been frozen, according to Xinhua.\\nThe blast happened at an outlet of Fuyang Barbecue, a chain restaurant in Yinchuan popular for its grilled skewers and stir-fried dishes, The Paper said. The two-floor restaurant could seat 20 people on the ground floor and offered private dining rooms on the second floor where customers could also sing karaoke.\\nThe Paper cited a woman identified only by her surname Chen saying she had been about 50 meters (164 feet) from the restaurant when she heard the explosion. She described seeing two waiters emerge from the restaurant afterward, one of whom collapsed immediately, while thick smoke billowed from the restaurant and a strong smell of cooking gas permeated the area.\\nThe central governments Ministry of Emergency Management said on social media that search and rescue work at the restaurant was completed early Thursday morning and investigators were working to determine the cause of the blast.\\nThe Dragon Boat Festival is a holiday devoted to eating rice dumplings and racing boats manned by teams of paddlers. While the majority of Yinchuans population is Han Chinese, a third are Hui people, or Chinese Muslims.\\nIndustrial accidents of this type are a regular occurrence in China, usually attributed to poor government supervision, corruption, cost-cutting measures by employers and little safety training for employees.\\nAt least nine people were killed in an explosion at a Chinese petrochemical plant, and three others died in a helicopter crash during the countrys May Day holiday.\\nIn February, 53 miners were killed in the collapse of a massive open pit coal mine in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, leading to numerous arrests, and four people were detained over a fire at an industrial trading company in central China in November that killed 38 people.\\nThe central government has pledged stronger safety measures since an explosion in 2015 at a chemical warehouse in the northern port city of Tianjin killed 173 people, most of them firefighters and police officers. In that case, a number of local officials were accused of having taken bribes to ignore safety violations.',\n",
       " '\\nRescuers on Wednesday rushed more ships and vessels to the area where a submersible disappeared on its way to the Titanic wreckage site, hoping underwater sounds they detected for a second straight day might help narrow their search in an increasingly urgent mission.\\nCrews were scouring an area twice the size of Connecticut in waters 2 1/2 miles deep, said Captain Jamie Frederick of the First Coast Guard District, who noted that authorities are still holding out hope of saving the five passengers onboard the Titan.\\nThis is a search and rescue mission, 100%, he said. ... Well continue to put every available asset that we have in an effort to find the Titan and the crew members.\\nBut even those who expressed optimism warned that many obstacles remain: from pinpointing the vessels location, to reaching it with rescue equipment, to bringing it to the surface  assuming its still intact. And all that has to happen before the passengers oxygen supply runs out, which some have estimated might happen as early as Thursday morning.\\nMeanwhile, newly uncovered allegations suggest there had been significant warnings made about vessel safety during the submersibles development.\\nThe area of the North Atlantic where the Titan went missing on Sunday is prone to fog and stormy conditions, making it an extremely challenging environment to conduct a search-and-rescue mission, said Donald Murphy, an oceanographer who served as chief scientist of the Coast Guards International Ice Patrol. The lost submersible could be as deep as about 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) below the surface near the watery tomb of the Titanic.\\nKey to the search are camera-equipped remote-operated robots, which are designed to scan the seafloor in real-time at depths other vessels cant reach. Two were operating in the area Wednesday and more were on the way, officials said.\\nFrederick said while the sounds that have been detected offered a chance to narrow the search, their exact location and source hasnt yet been determined.\\nWe dont know what they are, to be frank, he said.\\nRetired Navy Capt. Carl Hartsfield, now the director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Systems Laboratory, said the sounds have been described as banging noises, but he warned that search crews have to put the whole picture together in context and they have to eliminate potential manmade sources other than the Titan.\\nThe report was encouraging to some experts because submarine crews unable to communicate with the surface are taught to bang on their submersibles hull to be detected by sonar.\\nA U.S. Navy official said during a media briefing Wednesday that a special naval salvage system that could be used to pull the Titan to the surface has arrived in St. Johns, Canada, but it is expected to take another 24 hours to prepare it for use. The Navy said in a statement that the equipment is capable of hoisting large, bulky and heavy undersea objects such as aircraft or small vessels.\\nThe Titan weighs 20,000 pounds (9,071 kilograms). The Navys Flyaway Deep Ocean Salvage System is designed to lift up to 60,000 pounds (27,216kilograms).\\nThe submersible had seven backup systems to return to the surface, including sandbags and lead pipes that drop off and an inflatable balloon.\\nLost aboard the vessel are pilot Stockton Rush, the CEO of the company leading the expedition. His passengers are a British adventurer, two members of a Pakistani business family and a Titanic expert.\\nAuthorities reported the 22-foot carbon-fiber vessel overdue Sunday night, setting off the search in waters about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. Johns.\\nThe submersible had a four-day oxygen supply when it put to sea around 6 a.m. Sunday, according to David Concannon, an adviser to OceanGate Expeditions, which oversaw the mission.\\nFrank Owen, a submarine search and rescue expert, said the estimated 96-hour oxygen supply is a useful target for searchers, but is only based on a nominal amount of consumption. Owen said the diver on board the Titan would likely be advising passengers to do anything to reduce your metabolic levels so that you can actually extend this.\\nTitans passengers were likely enduring extremely difficult conditions, including temperatures just above freezing, said Jeff Karson, a professor emeritus of earth and environmental sciences at Syracuse University.\\nI am sure it is horrible down there, Karson said. It is like being in a snow cave and hypothermia is a real danger.\\nAt least 46 people successfully traveled on OceanGates submersible to the Titanic wreck site in 2021 and 2022, according to letters the company filed with a U.S. District Court in Norfolk, Virginia, that oversees matters involving the Titanic shipwreck.\\nBut documents show that OceanGate had been warned there might be catastrophic safety problems posed by the way the experimental vessel was developed.\\nDavid Lochridge, OceanGates director of marine operations, said in a 2018 lawsuit that the companys testing and certification was insufficient and would subject passengers to potential extreme danger in an experimental submersible.\\nThe company insisted that Lochridge was not an engineer and was not hired or asked to perform engineering services on the Titan. The firm also says the vessel under development was a prototype, not the now-missing Titan.\\nThe Marine Technology Society, which describes itself as a professional group of ocean engineers, technologists, policy-makers, and educators, also expressed concern that year in a letter to Rush, OceanGates chief executive. The society said it was critical that the company submit its prototype to tests overseen by an expert third party before launching in order to safeguard passengers. The New York Times first reported on those documents.\\nChris Brown, a British adventurer who paid a deposit to go on the Titan voyage but later withdrew because of what he called safety concerns, has criticized the use of a simple commercially available video game controller to steer the Titan. But OceanGate has said that many of the vessels parts are off-the-shelf because they have proved to be dependable.\\nIts meant for a 16-year-old to throw it around, and is super durable, Rush told the CBC in an interview last year while he demonstrated by throwing the controller around the Titans tiny cabin. He said a couple of spares are kept on board just in case.\\nThe search for the missing vessel has drawn international attention. In Dubai, where the missing British adventurer Hamish Harding lives, Crown Prince Hamadan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum wrote: Dubai and its people pray for their safety and hopeful return home.\\nOthers aboard include Pakistani nationals Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, whose eponymous firm invests across the country. In Pakistans port city of Karachi, employees at his firms said they prayed for the twos safe return, as did government officials. French explorer and Titanic expert Paul-Henry Nargeolet also was on the vessel.\\nRetired Navy Vice Admiral Robert Murrett, who is now deputy director of the Institute for Security Policy and Law at Syracuse University, said the disappearance of the submersible underscores the dangers associated with operating in deep water and the recreational exploration of the sea and space, two environments where in recent past weve seen people operate in hazardous, potentially lethal environments, Murrett said.\\nI think some people believe that because modern technology is so good, that you can do things like this and not have accidents, but thats just not the case, he said.',\n",
       " '\\nFor the first time, U.S. regulators on Wednesday approved the sale of chicken made from animal cells, allowing two California companies to offer lab-grown meat to the nations restaurant tables and eventually, supermarket shelves.\\nThe Agriculture Department gave the green light to Upside Foods and Good Meat, firms that had been racing to be the first in the U.S. to sell meat that doesnt come from slaughtered animals  whats now being referred to as cell-cultivated or cultured meat as it emerges from the laboratory and arrives on dinner plates.\\nThe move launches a new era of meat production aimed at eliminating harm to animals and drastically reducing the environmental impacts of grazing, growing feed for animals and animal waste.\\nInstead of all of that land and all of that water thats used to feed all of these animals that are slaughtered, we can do it in a different way, said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and chief executive of Eat Just, which operates Good Meat.\\nThe companies received approvals for federal inspections required to sell meat and poultry in the U.S. The action came months after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration deemed that products from both companies are safe to eat. A manufacturing company called Joinn Biologics, which works with Good Meat, was also cleared to make the products.\\nCultivated meat is grown in steel tanks, using cells that come from a living animal, a fertilized egg or a special bank of stored cells. In Upsides case, it comes out in large sheets that are then formed into shapes like chicken cutlets and sausages. Good Meat, which already sells cultivated meat in Singapore, the first country to allow it, turns masses of chicken cells into cutlets, nuggets, shredded meat and satays.\\nBut dont look for this novel meat in U.S. grocery stores anytime soon. Cultivated chicken is much more expensive than meat from whole, farmed birds and cannot yet be produced on the scale of traditional meat, said Ricardo San Martin, director of the Alt:Meat Lab at University of California Berkeley.\\nThe companies plan to serve the new food first in exclusive restaurants: Upside has partnered with a San Francisco restaurant called Bar Crenn, while Good Meat dishes will be served at a Washington, D.C., restaurant run by chef and owner Jose Andrs.\\nCompany officials are quick to note the products are meat, not substitutes like the Impossible Burger or offerings from Beyond Meat, which are made from plant proteins and other ingredients.\\nGlobally, more than 150 companies are focusing on meat from cells, not only chicken but pork, lamb, fish and beef, which scientists say has the biggest impact on the environment.\\nUpside, based in Berkeley, operates a 70,000-square-foot building in nearby Emeryville. On a recent Tuesday, visitors entered a gleaming commercial kitchen where chef Jess Weaver was sauteeing a cultivated chicken filet in a white wine butter sauce with tomatoes, capers and green onions.\\nThe finished chicken breast product was slightly paler than the grocery store version. Otherwise it looked, cooked, smelled and tasted like any other pan-fried poultry.\\nThe most common response we get is, Oh, it tastes like chicken, said Amy Chen, Upsides chief operating officer.\\nGood Meat, based in Alameda, operates a 100,000-square-foot plant, where chef Zach Tyndall dished up a smoked chicken salad on a sunny June afternoon. He followed it with a chicken thigh served on a bed of potato puree with a mushroom-vegetable demi-glace and tiny purple cauliflower florets. The Good Meat chicken product will come pre-cooked, requiring only heating to use in a range of dishes.\\nChen acknowledged that many consumers are skeptical, even squeamish, about the thought of eating chicken grown from cells.\\nWe call it the ick factor, she said.\\nThe sentiment was echoed in a recent poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Half of U.S. adults said that they are unlikely to try meat grown using cells from animals. When asked to choose from a list of reasons for their reluctance, most who said theyd be unlikely to try it said it just sounds weird. About half said they dont think it would be safe.\\nBut once people understand how the meat is made, theyre more accepting, Chen said. And once they taste it, theyre usually sold.\\nIt is the meat that youve always known and loved, she said.\\nCultivated meat begins with cells. Upside experts take cells from live animals, choosing those most likely to taste good and to reproduce quickly and consistently, forming high-quality meat, Chen said. Good Meat products are created from a master cell bank formed from a commercially available chicken cell line.\\nOnce the cell lines are selected, theyre combined with a broth-like mixture that includes the amino acids, fatty acids, sugars, salts, vitamins and other elements cells need to grow. Inside the tanks, called cultivators, the cells grow, proliferating quickly. At Upside, muscle and connective tissue cells grow together, forming large sheets. After about three weeks, the sheets of poultry cells are removed from the tanks and formed into cutlets, sausages or other foods. Good Meat cells grow into large masses, which are shaped into a range of meat products.\\nBoth firms emphasized that initial production will be limited. The Emeryville facility can produce up to 50,000 pounds of cultivated meat products a year, though the goal is to expand to 400,000 pounds per year, Upside officials said. Good Meat officials wouldnt estimate a production goal.\\nBy comparison, the U.S. produces about 50 billion pounds of chicken per year.\\nIt could take a few years before consumers see the products in more restaurants and seven to 10 years before they hit the wider market, said Sebastian Bohn, who specializes in cell-based foods at CRB, a Missouri firm that designs and builds facilities for pharmaceutical, biotech and food companies.\\nCost will be another sticking point. Neither Upside nor Good Meat officials would reveal the price of a single chicken cutlet, saying only that its been reduced by orders of magnitude since the firms began offering demonstrations. Eventually, the price is expected to mirror high-end organic chicken, which sells for up to $20 per pound.\\nSan Martin said hes concerned that cultivated meat may wind up being an alternative to traditional meat for rich people, but will do little for the environment if it remains a niche product.\\nIf some high-end or affluent people want to eat this instead of a chicken, its good, he said. Will that mean you will feed chicken to poor people? I honestly dont see it.\\nTetrick said he shares critics concerns about the challenges of producing an affordable, novel meat product for the world. But he emphasized that traditional meat production is so damaging to the planet it requires an alternative  preferably one that doesnt require giving up meat all together.\\nI miss meat, said Tetrick, who grew up in Alabama eating chicken wings and barbecue.

       " '\\nThere will be plenty of time to discuss global tensions during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to the U.S. this week. But hes starting his day Wednesday by highlighting a pursuit of inner tranquility.\\nAfter arriving in New York on Tuesday afternoon and holding private meetings, the leader of the worlds most populous nation kicks off his public schedule Wednesday with a group yoga session on the United Nations north lawn.\\nU.N. General Assembly President Csaba Kőrsi, Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed and many other diplomats and U.N. officials are expected to attend the event. It honors the International Day of Yoga, which Modi persuaded the U.N. to designate in 2014 as an annual observance.\\nThe yoga-themed U.N. visit is a savvy and symbolic choice for a premier who has made the ancient discipline both a personal practice and a diplomatic tool. First practiced by Hindu sages, yoga has now become one of Indias most popular cultural exports, and Modi has energetically promoted it as a  rather literal  feel-good way of stretching the countrys influence abroad.\\nModi, a Hindu nationalist, casts himself as an ascetic who adheres to his religions strictures on vegetarianism and yoga. He has posted social media videos over the years of himself practicing yoga poses (to say nothing of providing live visuals of him meditating in a Himalayan mountain cave after national elections in 2019).\\nModi last visited the U.N. during the 2021 General Assembly, where he said that all kinds of questions have been raised about the U.N. and its effectiveness on matters ranging from climate change to the coronavirus pandemic to terrorism.\\nHe also made a point of staking out his countrys place in the international community, noting that every sixth person in the world is Indian. In the years since his speech, India surpassed China to claim the worlds largest population, at 1.425 billion.\\nIndia has long sought a permanent seat on the Security Council, the U.N.s most powerful organ. India has been elected to a two-year seat several times, most recently for 2021-22.\\nModi heads to Washington later Wednesday for a three-day visit that includes an Oval Office meeting with President Joe Biden, an address to a joint meeting of Congress, a White House state dinner and more. Among the plans: a State Department luncheon hosted by Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mother was born in India, and by Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\\nThe visit comes as both countries are interested in strengthening ties.\\nThe U.S. has been looking to India, also the worlds biggest democracy, as a key partner on matters that include checking Chinas ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region. India, meanwhile, wants to bolster military and trade connections with the U.S.\\nHowever, human rights advocates are urging Biden to press Modi on human rights issues, both international and within India. Modi has faced criticism over legislation that fast-tracks citizenship for some migrants but excludes Muslims; a rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities by Hindu nationalists; and the recent conviction of Indias top opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, for mocking Modis surname. (Ghandi recently visited the U.S. himself, speaking to private organizations and university students.)\\nThe Indian government defends its human rights record and insists that the nations democratic principles remain rock-solid.',\n",
       " '\\nInmates had complained for weeks they were being threatened by gang members at a womens prison in Honduras. The gang fulfilled those threats, slaughtering 41 women, many of them burned, shot or stabbed to death.\\nPresident Xiomara Castro said Tuesdays riot at the prison in the town of Tamara, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of Honduras capital, was planned by maras (street gangs) with the knowledge and acquiescence of security authorities.\\nCastro pledged to take drastic measures, but did not explain how inmates identified as members of the Barrio 18 gang were able to get guns and machetes into the prison, or move freely into an adjoining cell block and slaughter all the prisoners there.\\nVideo clips presented by the government from inside the prison showed several pistols and a heap of machetes and other bladed weapons that were found after the riot.\\nSandra Rodrguez Vargas, the assistant commissioner for Honduras prison system, said the attackers removed guards at the facility  none appeared to have been injured  around 8 a.m. Tuesday and then opened the gates to an adjoining cell block and began massacring women there. They started a fire that left cell walls blacked and bunks reduced to twisted heaps of metal.\\nTwenty-six of the victims were burned to death and the remainder shot or stabbed, said Yuri Mora, the spokesman for Honduras national police investigation agency. At least seven inmates were being treated at a Tegucigalpa hospital.\\nThe riot appears to be the deadliest at a female detention center in Central America since 2017, when girls at a shelter for troubled youths in Guatemala set fire to mattresses to protest rapes and other mistreatment at the overcrowded institution. The smoke and fire killed 41 girls.\\nThe worst prison disaster in a century also occurred in Honduras, in 2012 at the Comayagua penitentiary, where 361 inmates died in a fire possibly caused by a match, cigarette or some other open flame.\\nThere were ample warnings ahead of Tuesdays tragedy, according to Johanna Paola Soriano Euceda, who was waiting outside the morgue in Tegucigalpa for news about her mother, Maribel Euceda, and sister, Karla Soriano. Both were on trial for drug trafficking but were held in the same area as convicted prisoners.\\nSoriano Euceda said they had told her Sunday that they (Barrio 18 members) were out of control, they were fighting with them all the time. That was the last time we talked.\\nAnother woman, who did not want to give her name for fear of reprisals, said she was waiting for news about a friend, Alejandra Martnez, 26, who was been held in the ill-fated Cell Block One on robbery charges.\\nShe told me the last time I saw her on Sunday that the (Barrio) 18 people had threatened them, that they were going to kill them if they didnt turn over a relative, she said.\\nGangs sometimes demand victims turn over a friend or relative by giving the gang their name, address and description, so that enforcers can later find and kidnap, rob or kill them.\\nOfficials described the killings as a terrorist act, but also acknowledged that gangs essentially had ruled some parts of the prison.\\nJulissa Villanueva, head of the prison system, suggested the riot started because of recent attempts by authorities to crack down on illicit activity inside prison walls and called Tuesdays violence a reaction to moves we are taking against organized crime.\\nWe will not back down, Villanueva said in a televised address after the riot.\\nGangs wield broad control inside the countrys prisons, where inmates often set their own rules and sell prohibited goods.\\nThey were also apparently able to smuggle in guns and other weapons, a recurring problem in Honduran prisons.\\nThe issue is to prevent people from smuggling in drugs, grenades and firearms, said Honduran human rights expert Joaquin Mejia. Todays events show that they have not been able to do that.\\nMeanwhile, the grim task continued of trying to identify the bodies, some terribly burned.\\nThe forensic teams that are removing bodies confirm they have counted 41, said Mora.\\nThe wait for news was torture for many families of inmates. Dozens of anxious, angry relatives gathered outside the rural prison.\\nWe are here dying of anguish, of pain ... we dont have any information, said Salomn Garca, whose daughter is an inmate at the facility.\\nAzucena Martinez, whose daughter was also being held at the prison, said there are a lot of dead, 41 already. We dont know if our relatives are also in there, dead.\\nTuesdays riot may increase the pressure on Honduras to emulate the drastic zero-tolerance, no-privileges prisons set in up in neighboring El Salvador by President Nayib Bukele. While El Salvadors crackdown on gangs has given rise to rights violations, it has also proved immensely popular in a country long terrorized by street gangs.',\n",
       " '\\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has wrapped up a closely watched visit to Beijing during which he and President Xi Jinping pledged to stabilize plunging U.S-China ties. But China refused the biggest U.S. request: restoring military-to-military contacts.\\nBlinken said he raised the issue of military communications repeatedly but was rebuffed by the Chinese. It is absolutely vital that we have these kinds of communications, he said, adding that it was something the United States will keep working on.\\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin and President Joe Biden have called often over the past few months for China to reestablish military communication channels with the U.S.\\nWHY DID CHINA HALT MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS?\\nChina suspended regular contacts with the U.S. military last August after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, challenging Beijings principle that other countries should refrain from official exchanges with self-governing Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory.\\nBut the problem existed even before Pelosis visit. The U.S. says China has declined or failed to respond to over a dozen requests from the Department of Defense for top-level dialogues since 2021.\\nWHY DOES THE U.S. WANT TO RESTORE MILITARY CONTACTS?\\nThe U.S. and other nations fear a potential accident involving the U.S. and Chinese militaries that could spiral out of control. In recent months, as tensions between Washington and Beijing have accelerated over a range of issues, including a suspected Chinese spy balloon over U.S. territory, there were several near-collisions of Chinese and U.S. military vessels and aircraft.\\nIn early June, a Chinese warship unexpectedly cut in front of a U.S. destroyer in the Taiwan Strait, forcing it to slow down to avoid impact. Days earlier, a Chinese fighter jet flew in front of a U.S. warplane over the South China Sea in a maneuver the U.S. described as unnecessarily aggressive.\\nWashington wants to avoid an incident like one in 2001, when a U.S. Navy aircraft and a Chinese interceptor jet collided in mid-air off the Chinese island of Hainan, leading to the Chinese pilots death and the U.S. aircraft forced to make an emergency landing in Hainan without Chinese approval.\\nThe most important thing for the U.S. side is to avoid these accidents, said Li Nan, a visiting senior fellow who researches Chinas military policy at the National University of Singapore.\\nWHY IS CHINA PUSHING BACK?\\nChina has attributed its refusal to restart military communications to sanctions imposed by Washington, a possible reference to sanctions on its defense minister, Li Shangfu. They were part of a broad package of measures against Russia, predating its invasion of Ukraine, imposed in 2018 over Lis involvement in Chinas purchase of combat aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles from Moscow.\\nThe U.S. side is surely aware of why there is difficulty in military-to-military exchanges, said Yang Tao, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official overseeing North American affairs, during a briefing Monday following Blinkens visit. One of the reasons is unilateral sanctions against the Chinese side. They first need to remove impediments and create conditions for military-to-military cooperation.\\nLi earlier this month declined an invitation to speak with Austin, his U.S. counterpart, on the sidelines of a defense forum in Singapore. The two officials did shake hands before sitting down at the same table during the forum, a gesture Austin said would not suffice. A cordial handshake over dinner is no substitute for a substantive engagement, he said.\\nThe U.S. says the sanctions dont prevent Li from holding talks with U.S. officials. But culturally, Chinese officials may expect a form of public remedy before agreeing to re-engage after sanctions, said Li Nan of the National University of Singapore.\\nYou impose sanctions on the guy, and then you also want to have dialogue with the guy, he said. From the Chinese perspective, that doesnt make any sense.\\nChina is also pushing back against NATOs increased collaboration with countries in the Asia-Pacific region - including Australia, Japan and New Zealand - which Beijing considers part of its own sphere of influence, said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor of China studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\\nWHATS DIFFERENT ABOUT HOW THE COUNTRIES SEE THEIR RELATIONSHIP?\\nXi said after his meeting with Blinken on Monday that The competition among major countries is not in line with the trend of the times, according to the Foreign Ministry.\\nBeijing instead sees U.S. policies toward China, such as curbing its access to important technology, as attempts to contain its rise.\\nThe United States and China are in a sense talking past each other, said Paul Haenle, a National Security Council official in the Bush and Obama administrations. At the highest level, there is still not agreement  in terms of how to two major powers should interact, and I think that will make it difficult for the two sides going forward.',\n",
       " '\\nGlaciers are melting at unprecedented rates across the Hindu Kush Himalayan mountain ranges and could lose up to 80% of their volume this century if greenhouse gas emissions arent sharply reduced, according to a report.\\nThe report Tuesday from Kathmandu-based International Center for Integrated Mountain Development warned that flash floods and avalanches would grow more likely in coming years, and that the availability of fresh water could be curtailed for nearly 2 billion people who live downstream of 12 rivers that originate in the mountains.\\nIce and snow in the Hindu Kush Himalayan ranges are an important source of water for those rivers, which flow through 16 countries in Asia and provide fresh water to 240 million people in the mountains and another 1.65 billion downstream.\\nThe people living in these mountains who have contributed next to nothing to global warming are at high risk due to climate change, said Amina Maharjan, a migration specialist and one of the reports authors. Current adaptation efforts are wholly insufficient, and we are extremely concerned that without greater support, these communities will be unable to cope.\\nTropical Storm Bret spins toward eastern Caribbean as forecasters warn of heavy rainfall\\nVarious earlier reports have found that the cryosphere  regions on Earth covered by snow and ice  are among the worst affected by climate change. Recent research found that Mount Everests glaciers, for example, have lost 2,000 years of ice in just the past 30 years.\\nWe map out for the first time the linkages between cryosphere change with water, ecosystems and society in this mountain region, Maharjan said.\\nAmong the key findings from Tuesdays report are that the Himalayan glaciers disappeared 65% faster since 2010 than in the previous decade, and that reducing snow cover due to global warming will result in reduced fresh water for people living downstream. The study found that 200 glacier lakes across these mountains are deemed dangerous, and the region could see a significant spike in glacial lake outburst floods by the end of the century.\\nThe study found that communities in the mountain regions are being affected by climate change far more than many other parts of the world. It says changes to the glaciers, snow and permafrost of the Hindu Kush Himalayan region driven by global warming are unprecedented and largely irreversible.\\nEffects of climate change are already felt by Himalayan communities, sometimes acutely. Earlier this year the Indian mountain town of Joshimath began sinking and residents had to be relocated within days.\\nOnce ice melts in these regions, its very difficult to put it back to its frozen form, said Pam Pearson, director of the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative, who was not involved with the report.\\nShe added, Its like a big ship in the ocean. Once the ice starts going, its very hard to stop. So, with glaciers, especially the big glaciers in the Himalayas, once they start losing mass, thats going to continue for a really long time before it can stabilize.\\nPearson said it is extremely important for Earths snow, permafrost and ice to limit warming to the 1.5 degrees Celsius agreed to at the 2015 Paris climate conference.\\nI get the sense that most policymakers dont take the goal seriously but, in the cryosphere, irreversible changes are already happening, she said.',\n",
       " '\\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met on Monday with Chinese President Xi Jinping and said they agreed to stabilize badly deteriorated U.S.-China ties, but Americas top diplomat left Beijing with his biggest ask rebuffed: better communications between their militaries.\\nAfter meeting Xi, Blinken said China is not ready to resume military-to-military contacts, something the U.S. considers crucial to avoid miscalculation and conflict, particularly over Taiwan.\\nStill, Chinas main diplomat for the Western Hemisphere, Yang Tao, said he thought Blinkens visit to China marks a new beginning.\\nThe U.S. side is surely aware of why there is difficulty in military-to-military exchanges, he said, blaming the issue squarely on U.S. sanctions, which Blinken said revolved entirely around threats to American security.\\nYet Blinken and Xi pronounced themselves satisfied with progress made during the two days of talks, without pointing to specific areas of agreement beyond a mutual decision to return to a broad agenda for cooperation and competition endorsed last year year by Xi and President Joe Biden at a summit in Bali.\\nAnd, it remained unclear if those understandings can resolve their most important disagreements, many of which have international implications. Still, both men said they were pleased with the outcome of the highest-level U.S. visit to China in five years.\\nThe two sides expressed a willingness to hold more talks, but there was little indication that either is prepared to bend from positions on issues including trade, Taiwan, human rights conditions in China and Hong Kong, Chinese military assertiveness in the South China Sea, and Russias war in Ukraine.\\nBlinken said later that the U.S. set limited objectives for the trip and achieved them. He told reporters before leaving for a Ukraine reconstruction conference in London that he had raised the issue of military to military communications repeatedly.\\nIt is absolutely vital that we have these kinds of communications, he said. This is something were going to keep working on.\\nSpeaking to reporters Monday during a campaign fundraising trip to California, Biden said Blinken did a hell of a job. The president said you know progress was made with relations between the U.S. and China because of the meeting.\\nThe U.S. has said that, since 2021, China has declined or failed to respond to over a dozen requests from the Department of Defense for top-level dialogues.\\nAccording to a transcript of the meeting with Blinken, Xi said he was pleased with the outcome of Blinkens earlier meetings with top Chinese diplomats and said restarting the Bali agenda were of great importance.\\nThe Chinese side has made our position clear, and the two sides have agreed to follow through the common understandings President Biden and I had reached in Bali, Xi said.\\nThat agenda had been thrown into jeopardy in recent months, notably after the U.S. shot down a Chinese surveillance balloon over its airspace in February, and amid escalated military activity in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Combined with other disputes over human rights, trade and opiate production, the list of problem areas is daunting.\\nBut also Xi suggested the worst could be over.\\nThe two sides have also made progress and reached agreement on some specific issues, Xi said without elaborating, according to a transcript of the remarks released by the State Department. This is very good.\\nIn his remarks to Xi during the 35-minute session at the Great Hall of the People, a meeting that was expected but not announced until an hour before it started, Blinken said the United States and China have an obligation and responsibility to manage our relationship.\\nThe United States is committed to doing that, Blinken said. Its in the interest of the United States, in the interests of China, and in the interest of the world.\\nBlinken described his earlier discussions with senior Chinese officials as candid and constructive.\\nDespite the symbolism of his presence in China, Blinken and other U.S. officials had played down the prospects for any significant breakthroughs on the most vexing issues facing the planets two largest economies.\\nInstead, these officials have emphasized the importance of the two countries establishing and maintaining better lines of communication.\\nThus, Chinas refusal to resume the military-to-military contacts was a hitch.\\nProgress is hard, Blinken told reporters. It takes time, it takes more than one visit.\\nBlinkens trip is expected to herald a new round of visits by senior U.S. and Chinese officials to each others countries, possibly including a meeting between Xi and Biden in India or the U.S in the coming months.\\nBefore meeting with Xi, Blinken met earlier Monday with Chinas top diplomat Wang Yi for about three hours, an encounter that produced a harsh assessment of the talks.\\nChinas foreign ministry said it is necessary to make a choice between dialogue or confrontation, cooperation or conflict. It blamed the U.S. sides erroneous perception of China, leading to incorrect policies towards China for the current low point in relations.\\nAnd, it said the U.S. bore responsibility for halting the spiraling decline of China-U.S. relations to push it back to a healthy and stable track. It added that Wang had demanded that the U.S. stop hyping up the China threat theory, lift illegal unilateral sanctions against China, abandon suppression of Chinas technological development, and refrain from arbitrary interference in Chinas internal affairs.\\nIn its readout of the meeting, the State Department said Blinken underscored the importance of responsibly managing the competition between the United States and the PRC through open channels of communication to ensure competition does not veer into conflict, using the acronym for the Peoples Republic of China.\\nIn the first round of talks on Sunday, Blinken met for nearly six hours with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, after which both countries said they had agreed to continue high-level discussions.\\nBoth the U.S. and China said Qin had accepted an invitation from Blinken to visit Washington but Beijing made clear that the China-U.S. relationship is at the lowest point since its establishment. That sentiment is widely shared by U.S. officials.\\nBlinkens visit came after his initial plans to travel to China were postponed in February after the shootdown of a Chinese surveillance balloon over the U.S.\\nIn his meetings, Blinken also pressed the Chinese to release detained American citizens and to take steps to curb the production and export of fentanyl precursors that are fueling the opioid crisis in the United States.\\nSince the cancellation of Blinkens trip in February, there have been some high-level engagements. CIA chief William Burns traveled to China in May, while Chinas commerce minister traveled to the U.S. And Bidens national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Wang Yi in Vienna in May.\\nBut those have been punctuated by bursts of angry rhetoric from both countries over the Taiwan Strait, their broader intentions in the Indo-Pacific, Chinas refusal to condemn Russia for its war against Ukraine, and U.S. allegations from Washington that Beijing is attempting to boost its worldwide surveillance capabilities, including in Cuba.\\nAnd, earlier this month, Chinas defense minister rebuffed a request from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for a meeting on the sidelines of a security symposium in Singapore, a sign of continuing discontent.',\n",
       " '\\nA rescue operation was underway deep in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean on Monday in search of a technologically advanced submersible vessel carrying five people to document the wreckage of the Titanic, the iconic ocean liner that sank more than a century ago.\\nThe vessel was reported overdue Sunday night about 435 miles (700 kilometres) south of St. Johns, Newfoundland, according to Canadas Joint Rescue Coordination Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Lt. Cmdr. Len Hickey said a Canadian Coast Guard vessel and military aircraft were assisting the search effort, which was being led by the U.S. Coast Guard in Boston.\\nRear Adm. John Mauger, a commander for the U.S. Coast Guard, said additional resources would arrive in the coming days.\\nIt is a remote area  and it is a challenge to conduct a search in that remote area, he said. But we are deploying all available assets to make sure we can locate the craft and rescue the people on board.\\nAccording to the Coast Guard, the craft submerged Sunday morning, and its support vessel lost contact with it about an hour and 45 minutes later.\\nThe submersible was operated by OceanGate Expeditions.\\nDavid Concannon, an adviser to OceanGate, said the submersible had an 96-hour oxygen supply starting at roughly 6 a.m. Sunday. In an email to The Associated Press, Concannon said he was supposed to be on the dive but could not go due to another client matter. He said officials were working to get a remotely operated vehicle that can reach a depth of 6,000 meters (about 20,000 feet) to the site as soon as possible.\\nOceanGates expeditions to the Titanic wreck site include archaeologists and marine biologists. The company also brings people who pay to come along, known as mission specialists. They take turns operating sonar equipment and performing other tasks in the five-person submersible. The Coast Guard said Monday that there was one pilot and four mission specialists aboard.\\nOceanGate said its focus was on those aboard and their families.\\nWe are deeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to reestablish contact with the submersible, said a written statement from the company.\\nU.K. businessman Hamish Harding was one of the mission specialists, according to Action Aviation, a company for which Harding serves as chairman. The companys managing director, Mark Butler, told the AP that the crew set out on Friday.\\nThere is still plenty of time to facilitate a rescue mission, there is equipment on board for survival in this event, Butler said. Were all hoping and praying he comes back safe and sound.\\nHarding is an adventurer who holds three Guinness World Records, including longest duration at full ocean depth by a crewed vessel. In March 2021, he and ocean explorer Victor Vescovo dived to the lowest depth of the Mariana Trench. In June 2022, he went into space on Blue Origins New Shepard rocket.\\nThe expedition was OceanGates third annual voyage to chronicle the deterioration of Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank in 1912, killing all but about 700 of the roughly 2,200 passengers and crew. Since the wreckages discovery in 1985, it has been slowly succumbing to metal-eating bacteria. Some have predicted the ship could vanish in a matter of decades as holes yawn in the hull and sections disintegrate.\\nThe initial group of tourists in 2021 paid $100,000 to $150,000 apiece to go on the trip.\\nUnlike submarines that leave and return to port under their own power, submersibles require a ship to launch and recover them. OceanGate hired the Canadian vessel Polar Prince, a medium duty icebreaker that was formerly operated by the Canadian Coast Guard, to ferry dozens of people and the submersible craft to the North Atlantic wreck site. The submersible would make multiple dives in one expedition.\\nThe expedition was scheduled to depart from St. Johns, Newfoundland, in early May and finish up at the end of June, according to documents filed by the company in April with a U.S. District Court in Virginia that oversees Titanic matters.\\nThe submersible, named Titan, is capable of diving 4,000 meters or 13,120 feet with a comfortable safety margin, OceanGate said in its court filing.\\nIt weighs 20,000 pounds (9,072 kilograms) in the air, but is ballasted to be neutrally buoyant once it reaches the seafloor, the company said.\\nThe Titan is made of titanium and filament wound carbon fiber and has proven to withstand the enormous pressures of the deep ocean, OceanGate stated. OceanGate told the court that Titans viewport is the largest of any deep diving submersible and that its technology provides an unrivaled view of the deep ocean.\\nIn a May 2021 court filing, OceanGate said the Titan had an unparalleled safety feature that assesses the integrity of the hull throughout every dive.\\nAt the time of the filing, Titan had undergone more than 50 test dives, including to the equivalent depth of the Titanic, in deep waters off the Bahamas and in a pressure chamber, the company said.\\nDuring its expedition in 2022, OceanGate reported that the submersible had a battery issue on its first dive, and had to be manually attached to its lifting platform, according to a November court filing.\\nIn the high sea state, the submersible sustained modest damage to its external components and OceanGate decided to cancel the second mission for repairs and operational enhancements, the filing stated.\\nMore missions, however, followed. The company reported that 28 people visited the wreck site last year.\\nExperts said Monday that rescuers face steep challenges.\\nAlistair Greig, a professor of marine engineering at University College London, said submersibles typically have a drop weight, which is a mass they can release in the case of an emergency to bring them up to the surface using buoyancy.\\nIf there was a power failure and/or communication failure, this might have happened, and the submersible would then be bobbing about on the surface waiting to be found, Greig said.\\nAnother scenario is a leak in the pressure hull, in which case the prognosis is not good, he said.\\nIf it has gone down to the seabed and cant get back up under its own power, options are very limited, Greig said. While the submersible might still be intact, if it is beyond the continental shelf, there are very few vessels that can get that deep, and certainly not divers.\\nEven if they could go that deep, he doubts they could attach to the hatch of OceanGates submersible.\\nChris Parry, a retired navy rear admiral from the U.K., told Sky News the rescue was a very difficult operation.\\nThe actual nature of the seabed is very undulating. Titanic herself lies in a trench. Theres lots of debris around. So trying to differentiate with sonar in particular and trying to target the area you want to search in with another submersible is going to be very difficult indeed.',\n",

Yadav, a medical officer in Ballia, said in the past three days, some 300 patients were admitted to the district hospital for various ailments aggravated by heat.\\nDue to the gravity of the situation, authorities canceled leave applications of medical personnel in Ballia and provided additional hospital beds in the emergency ward to accommodate the influx of patients.\\nOfficials said most of the admitted patients are aged 60 and above, exhibiting symptoms of high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing difficulties and heart-related issues.\\nR.S. Pathak, a resident of Ballia who lost his father on Saturday, said that he witnessed an increased flow of patients at the hospitals emergency ward while attending to his father.\\nThis has never happened in Ballia. I have never seen people dying because of the heat in such large numbers, he said. People fear venturing out. The roads and markets are largely deserted.\\nBallia, along with central and eastern Uttar Pradesh, is currently grappling with oppressive heat.\\nOn Sunday, the district experienced a maximum temperature of 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit), surpassing the normal range by five degrees. The relative humidity was recorded at 25%, intensifying the effect of the heat.\\nAtul Kumar Singh, a scientist from the India Meteorological Department, or IMD, said temperatures across the state were presently above normal. He added, no relief is expected in the next 24 hours.\\nThe IMD issued an alert saying heat wave conditions would last until June 19 in parts of Uttar Pradesh.\\nThe states health minister, Brijesh Pathak, said that they have opened an investigation into the cause of death of so many people in Ballia.\\nIn eastern Bihar, scorching heat has engulfed most of the state, leading to 42 deaths in the past two days. Among the fatalities, 35 occurred at two hospitals in the state capital of Patna where over 200 patients suffering from diarrhea and vomiting were being treated.\\nPatna recorded a maximum temperature of 44.7 C Celsius (113 F) on Saturday.\\nThe main summer months  April, May and June  are generally the hottest in most of India, before monsoon rains bring in cooler temperatures.\\nBut temperatures have become more intense in the past decade. During heat waves, the country usually suffers severe water shortages, with tens of millions of its 1.4 billion people lacking running water.\\nA study by World Weather Attribution, an academic group that examines the source of extreme heat, found that a searing heat wave in April that struck parts of South Asia was made at least 30 times more likely by climate change.\\nIn April, the heat caused the death of 13 people at a government event in Indias financial capital of Mumbai and prompted some states to close all schools for a week.']"
